US Concludes IS Explosives Led to 100+ Civilian Deaths in March Airstrike,"US Concludes Islamic State Explosives Led to 100+ Civilian Deaths in March Airstrike share Print PENTAGON — 
A U.S. military investigation into a deadly March airstrike has found that a secondary explosion caused the deaths of more than 100 civilians in Mosul, Iraq. 
U.S. Central Command, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East, said Thursday the investigation determined that Islamic State fighters had placed “large amounts” of explosives in a building that housed civilians and then began attacking Iraqi forces from that building. 
When the coalition targeted snipers on the roof, the explosives detonated, killing at least 101 civilians sheltering in the bottom floors and four civilians in a neighboring structure. 
U.S. Central Command said Thursday “weapons and structural experts concluded, based on extensive modeling, (that) the structural damage to the building was in a different location” than where the airstrike hit and was “in excess” of what could have been caused by the single GBU-38 munition used in the March 17 strike. 
Neither the U.S.-led coalition nor Iraqi forces who called in the strike knew that civilians were sheltered in the building, Central Command said. 
""Our condolences go out to all those that were affected,"" said Maj. Gen. Joe Martin, Commanding General of the Combined Joint Forces Land Component Command in Iraq and Syria. 
The U.S. military looked at more than 700 separate video feeds covering 10 days of airstrikes in Mosul to determine the credibility of the civilian casualty reports. 
The Pentagon has called the death of civilians in Iraq's northern city of Mosul a terrible tragedy. 
""There is no military force in the world that has proven more sensitive to civilian casualties,” U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said shortly after the strike. “We go out of our way to always do everything humanly possible to reduce the loss of life or injury among innocent people. The same cannot be said for our adversaries.” 
At the time of the strike, the Iraqi military cited evidence it said showed that Islamic State fighters placed explosives at the site. 
""All of [the building's] walls were rigged with bombs, and there is no hole or signs that it was an airstrike target,"" the Iraqi military's Joint Command said. 
U.S. officials have stressed to VOA that the U.S. military is fully capable of striking one building while leaving its surroundings unscathed."

Attorneys: Salvadoran Colonel's Health Declining in New Jail,"Attorneys: Salvadoran Colonel's Health Declining in New Jail share Print RALEIGH, N.C. — 
Defense attorneys say medical care for a former Salvadoran colonel accused of helping to plot five killings is declining since his transfer to a new facility to await a final decision on his extradition. A lawyer for Inocente Orlando Montano Morales says in a filing that routine blood sugar checks were missed and he has had a fever and other symptoms indicating that he could have a new infection. Judge Terrence Boyle had tried to send Montano to a federal prison hospital because of concerns about his health, but the transfer wasn't possible. Instead, he was sent from a North Carolina lockup to a Virginia jail. The U.S. Marshals Service said it was following procedures for reviewing Montano's complaints but couldn't provide details.

"Congress, Paul Ryan Condemn Turkish Embassy Clashes","Congress, Paul Ryan Condemn Turkish Embassy Clashes share Print 
The U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee Thursday officially condemned the violent crackdown on protests outside the Turkish embassy in Washington last week. 
""This timely resolution sends a clear signal to the Turkish government that we will not allow any foreign government to stifle the rights of our citizens,"" the committee said in a statement following the passage of House Resolution 354, which condemned the violence against what it deemed peaceful protests. 
U.S. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan thanked the committee, echoing concerns over the incident that have been expressed by U.S. lawmakers and diplomats for days. Demonstrators lie on the ground following a brawl with Turkish security personnel near the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington, May 17, 2017. (screengrab from VOA Turkish video) 
“The violent crackdown on peaceful protesters by Turkish security forces was completely indefensible, and the [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan government’s response was wholly inadequate,"" he said in a statement. ""I want to thank Chairman [Ed] Royce, Ranking Member [Eliot] Engel, and all members of the Foreign Affairs Committee for taking swift action on this issue.” 
The committee was expected to hold a hearing discussing the right to peaceful protest later Thursday. 
The clash broke out between Turkish security personnel and protesters outside the Turkish ambassador's residence during Erdogan's visit to Washington. 
Protesters say they were attacked by Turkish security forces as they demonstrated peacefully. Turkey blamed the clash on the demonstrators, claiming they aggressively provoked people who had gathered to see Erdogan. Related"
Peace Activists Focus on Reducing Military Spending at Counter-NATO Summit,"Peace Activists Focus on Reducing Military Spending at Counter-NATO Summit share Print BRUSSELS — 
While NATO heads of states are meeting in their newest headquarters to discuss increasing defense budget spending, leading peace activists from around the world are gathered for a counter-summit to advocate for less militarization. 
Military spending will be one of the issues topping the NATO summit agenda Thursday in Brussels. Increasing defense spending to 2 percent of GDP is a requirement for member countries, but only five of the 28 abide by this rule. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks beside NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at the start of the NATO summit at their new headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, May 25, 2017. 
President Donald Trump has been vocal since his campaign that other member states need to meet the budget obligation. Elsewhere in Brussels, more than 100 international peace activists are holding their own summit, focusing not only on less military spending, but on completely phasing out NATO over a number of years. Police detain a demonstrator during a protest against a NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium, May 25, 2017. 
Ingeborg Breines of International Peace Bureau says the arguments against NATO are economic, social and environmental. “We think that the costs are so high for the military that we don’t have the means to cater to the means of people. The effects of societies of war are that they migrate by need. And ecologically, we misuse national resources such as minerals and energy and dig oils to keep the military machine going.” The U.S. president had called NATO “obsolete” during his campaign, but said in April that NATO has been the “bulwark of international peace and security.” FILE - Jean-Luc Melenchon attends a television debate at French private TV channels BFM TV and CNews, in La Plaine-Saint-Denis, outside Paris, April 4, 2017.

Ann Wright is a retired U.S. army colonel and former diplomat. She resigned over the Iraq war in 2003 and is now part of Veterans for Peace. Wright is worried about the militarization of U.S. foreign policy, although she admits it is unlikely NATO will ever disappear. “If you look at the reduction in militarization of the world, we have been a failure. But there’s another way to look at this. I think it’s totally possible and there should be a huge reduction in the amount of money that’s spent by each of the nations. The increase that has happened since the annexation of Crimea by Russia is extraordinary.” The day before the summit, a large demonstration was held in Brussels against President Trump's visit, but many signs at the protest also were critical of NATO. Protesters carry effigies of US President Donald Trump and Belgian PM Charles Michel during a demonstration in the center of Brussels, May 24, 2017. 
The outcomes of the counter-summit and how to slowly phase out budgets for NATO are not shared with the heads of states as there is no interaction between the two, according to organizer Ludo De Brabander. “Even if we would like to, it would be difficult. I don’t think these kinds of summits take us very serious. Because we have messages that are really very much opposed to what their aims are. But we organize this because it’s very important to inform the population,"" said De Brabander. ""If we do a demonstration, it’s a very public event. And for us its very important to tell people what NATO really is. And that it’s not in the interest of the population to have an organization such as NATO.” The counter-summits have been organized since 2009, always coinciding with the bloc's summits. With NATO having just agreed to increase support to the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, it’s likely that military budgets are staying even or increasing. NATO accounts for more than half of all money that is spent world wide on military budgets. And the new headquarters, inaugurated at the summit on Thursday, was reported to have cost over $1 billion.

Appeals Court Upholds Stay on Trump Travel Order,"U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Thursday that he would ask the Supreme Court to review an appeals court ruling that blocks President Donald Trump's executive order limiting travel to the U.S. from six predominantly Muslim countries.
Sessions issued a statement saying, ""President Trump's executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe.""
""The Department of Justice strongly disagrees with the decision of the divided court, which blocks the president's efforts to strengthen this country's national security. ... The president is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism, until he determines that they can be properly vetted and do not pose a security risk to the United States,"" the attorney general said.
Sessions was responding to a ruling earlier in the day by the Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, in which it declined to reinstate the three-month ban on most travelers from the six nations.
The court said the executive order did amount to a Muslim ban. ""Laid bare, this executive order is no more than what the president promised before and after his election: naked invidious discrimination against Muslims,"" the judges said in their 205-page ruling.
A majority of the panel of 13 judges ruling in the case cited Trump's tweets, television interviews and statements posted on his campaign website as evidence of his intent.
Three judges dissented on the ground that the executive order did not mention religion.
""Far from containing the sort of religious advocacy or disparagement that can violate the Establishment Clause, the order contains no reference to religion whatsoever. Nor is there any trace of discriminatory animus,"" the dissenting judges wrote.
They also criticized the use of campaign material as evidence: ""If a court, dredging through the myriad remarks of a campaign, fails to find material to produce the desired outcome, what stops it from probing deeper to find statements from a previous campaign, or from a previous business conference, or from college?""
In March, a federal judge in Maryland blocked the travel ban, which itself was a revised version of one issued in January that was tweaked after encountering legal roadblocks.
The appeals court majority did not think the second version was an improvement.
""Significantly, in revising the order, the executive branch did not attempt to walk away from its previous discriminatory order. Instead, it simply attempted to effectuate the same discrimination through a slightly different vehicle — the proverbial wolf in sheep's clothing.""
The Trump administration was given 90 days to appeal.
One of the plaintiffs in the suit, the International Refugee Assistance Project, vowed to fight ""as long as it takes."" IRAP's director, Becca Heller, said: ""Once again, the courts have confirmed that the Muslim ban is discriminatory and harmful. The president cannot simply slap the words 'national security' on an unconstitutional policy and get away with it.""
A part of the executive order stopping refugee arrivals for 120 days was not included in Thursday's ruling. But a second appeals court, the 9th Circuit in San Francisco, is reviewing the travel order on a wider basis, including the ban on refugees.
The original stay in the 9th Circuit case was issued by a judge in Hawaii.

Senate Panel Backs New Sanctions on Iran,"CAPITOL HILL — A Senate panel has overwhelmingly approved new U.S. sanctions targeting Iran's support for international terrorism and its ballistic missile program, the first move to punish Tehran since a landmark nuclear accord went into effect.
Thursday's 18-3 vote by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee came days after President Donald Trump pledged common cause with Israel and Sunni Arab states to counter Iranian influence in the region.
""The bill passed overwhelmingly today [in committee] and I believe will pass overwhelmingly on the Senate floor,"" said the committee's chairman, Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee.
""If you think about what just happened with the [president's] trip to Saudi Arabia, this begins to coordinate a Middle Eastern strategy that counters Iran's aggression in the region. There is a move to push back against the many nefarious activities that Iran has been engaged in,"" Corker added.
Eight of the committee's 10 Democrats backed the bill, including Chris Coons of Delaware, who, in 2015, supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal.
""This bill shows a continuing determination by the American Congress to stand up to Iran's continued, even expanded malign activities around the world: their ongoing ballistic missile launches, their support for terrorism, their human rights violations,"" Coons said. ""All of these are areas that are specifically called out in the JCPOA as areas where it is appropriate and possible for the United States, if necessary, to impose additional sanctions.""
Ahead of the vote, a central figure in nuclear negotiations with Iran, former secretary of state John Kerry, took to Twitter to warn against new sanctions, writing: ""There are many tools to up the pressure already in place and at our disposal. We need to weigh/consider risk to JCPOA.""
That concern was shared by the bill's opponents in the Senate, including Democrat Tom Udall of New Mexico.
""Let's remember, the Iranians have just had an election, re-elected [President Hassan] Rouhani, who was a supporter of this agreement and he was re-elected by a big margin,"" Udall said. ""So the first move of our government with this legislation is going to be to threaten the [nuclear] agreement. I think that's a very bad posture for us.""
Such concerns are unwarranted, according to backers of the sanctions.
""We know that this in no way touches the nuclear deal,"" Corker said.
""Tehran can argue all they want that these areas for additional sanctions are not permitted under the JCPOA,"" Coons said. ""The plain text of the agreement allows additional sanctions in these three areas [support for terrorism, missile development, and human rights].""
The committee's lone Republican to oppose bill, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, argued that punishing Iranian missile development makes no sense after President Trump inked a major arms deal with Iran's arch-rival, Saudi Arabia.
""If we want Iran to stop or lessen their development of ballistic weapons, we need to address the cause: the arms race in the Middle East,"" Paul said.
Between Trump's actions and the sanctions bill, no one is disputing that a shift has occurred away from the former Obama administration's handling of Iran.
""Some chose to believe that the regime in Tehran would respond to the JCPOA and the opportunity it gave the Iranian government to change their behavior, to engage with the West, to demonstrate that it wants to become part of the community of nations,"" Coons said. ""In the last year their [Iran's] actions have proven the opposite, and I think it's now appropriate for us to take these steps [impose sanctions].""
Many will be watching Iran's reaction if the sanctions become law. Asked by VOA if he is concerned about how the bill will be viewed in Tehran, Corker shrugged.
""Are you talking about the people, [or] are you talking about this revolutionary leadership that is carrying out terrorism throughout the Middle East?"" Corker responded. ""I can't answer for both."""
"Fitness Trackers Bad at Measuring Calories Burned, Study Says","Fitness Trackers Bad at Measuring Calories Burned, Study Says share See comments 
It’s probably not a good idea to decide what to eat based on how many calories your wearable fitness tracker says you’ve burned, according to a new study. 
Researchers at Stanford University in California, who tested several popular fitness trackers on 60 volunteers, say the fitness trackers are good for measuring heart rate and counting steps, but they’re bad at measuring energy expenditure. 
The volunteers, 29 men and 31 women, engaged in a variety of physical activities, including walking or running on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike. Their heart rates were measured using a medical-grade electrocardiograph. Energy expenditure was determined by measuring the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the volunteers’ breath. 
Six of the seven devices tested, which included the Apple Watch, Basis Peak, Fitbit Surge, Microsoft Band, Mio Alpha 2, PulseOn and the Samsung Gear S2, did a good job measuring heart rate, coming within 5 percent of the accuracy of the electrocardiograph. 
However, when it came to measuring calories burned, they did not do a very good job, with the most accurate tracker off by 27 percent. One was off by 93 percent. 
“People are basing life decisions on the data provided by these devices,” said Euan Ashley, a professor of cardiovascular medicine, of genetics and of biomedical data science at Stanford, who added that consumer devices aren’t held to the same standards as medical devices. 
Ashley was surprised by the results. 
“The heart rate measurements performed far better than we expected,” he said. “But the energy expenditure measures were way off the mark. The magnitude of just how bad they were surprised me.” 
The findings were published May 24 in the Journal of Personalized Medicine . Your opinion"

Greece: Ex-PM Injured in Car Blast,"Former Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos was injured Thursday when a bomb exploded inside his vehicle in Athens, officials said.
Two Bank of Greece employees in the car were also injured. All three were conscious and hospitalized in stable condition, government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said, calling the blast an ""attack.""
""With all out heart, we wish Mr. Papademos and his companions a speedy recovery. The prime minister has been updated about all the events by the minister of public order and he will continue to receive updates,'' Tzanakopoulos said.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
Papademos, 69,served as Greece's prime minister for six months in 2011 and 2012 after socialist George Papandreou resigned during the debt crisis to make way for a national unity government.
A respected economist and former European Central Bank deputy governor, Papademos steered the country through tough austerity measures and was credited with preventing the collapse of the country's international bailout at the time."

"Fitness Trackers Bad at Measuring Calories Burned, Study Says","It’s probably not a good idea to decide what to eat based on how many calories your wearable fitness tracker says you’ve burned, according to a new study.
Researchers at Stanford University in California, who tested several popular fitness trackers on 60 volunteers, say the fitness trackers are good for measuring heart rate and counting steps, but they’re bad at measuring energy expenditure.
The volunteers, 29 men and 31 women, engaged in a variety of physical activities, including walking or running on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike. Their heart rates were measured using a medical-grade electrocardiograph. Energy expenditure was determined by measuring the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the volunteers’ breath.
Six of the seven devices tested, which included the Apple Watch, Basis Peak, Fitbit Surge, Microsoft Band, Mio Alpha 2, PulseOn and the Samsung Gear S2, did a good job measuring heart rate, coming within 5 percent of the accuracy of the electrocardiograph.
However, when it came to measuring calories burned, they did not do a very good job, with the most accurate tracker off by 27 percent. One was off by 93 percent.
“People are basing life decisions on the data provided by these devices,” said Euan Ashley, a professor of cardiovascular medicine, of genetics and of biomedical data science at Stanford, who added that consumer devices aren’t held to the same standards as medical devices.
Ashley was surprised by the results.
“The heart rate measurements performed far better than we expected,” he said. “But the energy expenditure measures were way off the mark. The magnitude of just how bad they were surprised me.”
The findings were published May 24 in the Journal of Personalized Medicine ."

Fresh Taliban Attacks Kill 25 Members of Afghan Forces,"Fresh Taliban Attacks Kill 25 Members of Afghan Forces share Print ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN — 
A suicide car bombing and clashes with Taliban insurgents across Afghanistan have killed at least 25 security personnel. 
The violence comes as the United Nations urges parties to the Afghan conflict to cease hostilities during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, beginning this week. 
Local television stations quoted security officials in the embattled Helmand province as saying that a suicide bomber Thursday afternoon rammed his explosives-laden car into an office of the Afghan intelligence agency. 
Initial reports said at least six people were killed and several more wounded. The district chief of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), Tor Jan, was said to be among the dead. 
The Taliban claimed credit for the violence, with a spokesman saying the massive explosion destroyed the facility in the Washir district and killed at least 20 people, including Jan. 
The Islamist insurgency often releases inflated tolls for such attacks. Helmand is the largest Afghan province and is mostly controlled by, or under the influence of, the Taliban. 
Meanwhile, officials in neighboring Kandahar province have confirmed that a Taliban ambush Wednesday night left at least 13 Afghan soldiers dead and eight others wounded. 
Defense Ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri said in Kabul that dozens of insurgents participated in the deadly assault that targeted an Afghan military base in the Maiwand district. He added that Afghan forces drove the assailants back, killing about 20 of them. 
This was the second insurgent attack on a military installation this week in Kandahar. 
Taliban fighters on Monday night staged a surprise assault on several security outposts in the Shahwali Kot district, killing at least 20 Afghan soldiers and wounding 15 others. 
On Wednesday, the Taliban also assaulted security outposts in western Badghis province, killing at least six Afghan forces and wounding several others. 
The increase in the number of casualties among Afghan security forces has been a cause of serious concern for the government and its international partners. 
The head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, or UNAMA, has appealed for a cessation in hostilities during Ramadan. 
""In the same spirit, I would like to call parties to the conflict to respect this religious obligation and halt the fighting,"" said Tadamichi Yamamoto. 
Also Thursday, officials in the northern Afghan city of Kunduz reported that a Taliban rocket attack in the early morning hit a school in the provincial capital, killing at least one student and wounding nine others. 
The deaths come as Afghan civilian casualties already have risen to record levels in the first four months of 2017, according to UNAMA. Related"

US Urges China to Release Jailed Taiwanese NGO Worker,"US Urges China to Release Jailed Taiwanese NGO Worker share See comments STATE DEPARTMENT — 
After the Chinese government detained her husband on March 19, Ching-yu Lee, wife of Taiwanese nongovernmental organization worker Ming-che Lee, dedicated herself to a rescue mission that raises international awareness and seeks his release. 
Ching-yu Lee received a warm reception from senior U.S. officials and congressional members during a recent trip to Washington. 
A State Department spokesman told VOA on Wednesday that Virginia Bennett, the acting assistant secretary for democracy, human rights and labor affairs, greeted Lee and a delegation of wives of human rights activists who are detained in China. Virginia Bennett, the U.S. State Department’s acting assistant secretary for democracy, human rights and labor affairs, greeted Ching-yu Lee at the department, May 17, 2017. (whereislee.org) 
""We are aware of reports that China has detained Ming-che Lee, a human rights advocate from Taiwan, under vague state security charges and without access to a lawyer or family,"" she said. ""We urge the immediate release of all who have been detained for advocacy on behalf of democracy and human rights."" 
Flight to Macau 
Lee, 42, disappeared on March 19 after a flight from Taipei to the Chinese territory of Macau and before crossing a land border into mainland China where a friend was waiting, according to his colleagues in Taipei. His whereabouts remain unknown. 
Lee's wife pledged to ""continue to move forward"" with the rescue campaign. 
""As human rights workers, we don't have the rights to be pessimistic,"" Lee said this week after returning to Taipei. 
Matthew Pottinger, White House National Security Council senior director for Asian affairs, shared his experience in a recent meeting, according to Lee. Pottinger was detained in 2004 when, as a reporter for The Wall Street Journal , he was covering news in a village in China's Jiangsu province. In a photo taken on May 19, Matthew Pottinger, White House National Security Council senior director for Asian affairs, shared his experience with Ching-yu Lee, May 19, 2017. (whereislee.org) 
Pottinger told Lee to help her husband ""learn to let go,"" if released, of all kinds of humiliation and torture that may occur during isolation and secret interrogation. ""Help him to be at peace with himself,"" said Pottinger, Lee recalled in a blog . 
Lee's case has sparked debate about whether China has the right to jail him. 
China claims democratically ruled Taiwan is part of its territory, and it has never renounced the use of military force to bring the island under Beijing's control. The U.S. broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1979. 
Some ties continue 
The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) approved that year by Congress allows the continuation of ""commercial, cultural and other relations between the people of the United States and the people of Taiwan"" in the absence of diplomatic ties. 
""Nothing contained in this act shall contravene the interest of the United States in human rights,"" the TRA says. ""The preservation and enhancement of the human rights of all the people on Taiwan are hereby reaffirmed as objectives of the United States."" 
Ross Darrell Feingold, a Taiwan-based American lawyer and political risk consultant, told VOA, ""China's government won't be persuaded by arguments that it lacks the jurisdiction to detain Lee, as it will, of course, cite its broad national security laws as a sufficient reason to detain him."" 
Feingold, who is the Asia director of the Association of American Residents Overseas, said Lee's case is different from others. While there is a recent history of numerous detentions involving both foreign businesspersons and nongovernmental organization workers, ""often those detained are based in China, rather than short-term visitors,"" he said. 
Coen Blaauw, a spokesman for the Washington-based Formosan Association for Public Affairs, which promotes Taiwan's self-determination, told VOA that by ""arresting and detaining Taiwanese citizens,"" the Chinese do not ""enamor them to the people of Taiwan."" 
Looking to Congress 
Lee and wives of other human rights activists detained by China — mainland lawyers Jingling Tang, Tianyong Jiang and Yang Xie — issued their appeals at a recent congressional hearing, calling on Washington to press Beijing to free activists and end torture. 
ChinaAid, a U.S.-based nonprofit Christian human rights organization, said the wives presented the cases of their jailed husbands to American lawmakers May 18, asking them to ""examine the torture, disappearances and detention of human rights lawyers and democracy advocates in China."" 
ChinaAid facilitated the meetings of activists' wives with U.S. officials and congressional members.

US-China Ties in Arts and Education Deepen,"US-China Ties in Arts and Education Deepen share See comments LOS ANGELES — 
On the political and military front, U.S.-China relations have been an often-tense dance between governments. However, in arts and education, many say the relationship is deepening. There is debate among Americans as to whether the ties are positive or negative. 
Some say this is progress that is reaping economic and cultural benefits for citizens in both countries. 
""When people collaborate on making anything artistic, there's an emotional pull inside of that and if it works well, you not only have a great business, you also have a great diplomatic cohesion between the two countries,"" said Chris Fenton, U.S.-Asia Institute Trustee and the President of DMG Entertainment. 
In August, Fenton will be taking a group of U.S. lawmakers to China to look at the country's growing entertainment and media industry, with the hope of even more Chinese investment in Hollywood. On Jan. 21, 2011, then-Chinese President Hu Jintao visits the The Confucius Institute which is housed at Walter Payton College Preparatory High School in Chicago. 
Chinese language and culture 
China has also been investing in educating Americans in language and culture through its Confucius Institutes. Mandarin immersion kindergarten teacher Carol Chen says the University of California Los Angeles Confucius Institute has been a good resource for her and her students. 
""For example, books and also resources of our Chinese cultures. One of the years, they actually brought Chinese folk culture tradition to the campus,"" said Chen, who teaches at Broadway Elementary, a dual language immersion school. 
Funded by the Chinese government, there are nearly 500 Confucius Institutes globally, most on university campuses. The UCLA Confucius Institute taps into the local Mandarin-speaking population to develop a pipeline of Mandarin teachers. It also provides cross-cultural programs in the arts.""Bringing more artists together and exposing them to each other's culture and to shared cultural experience with China, you're sort of training, sort of a new generation of diplomats,"" said Susan Pertel Jain, UCLA Confucius Institute Executive Director. 
But long-time critic and academic Perry Link says Confucius Institutes are an example of China's soft power. 
""Soft power is cultural or educational things that cause people in other countries to view one's own country in a more friendly way. To reach out into the world with soft power is a new thing from the Chinese government's point of view, but an important thing because the rest of the successful world seems to be doing it,"" said Link, who is the University of California Riverside's Chancellorial Chair for Innovation in Teaching Across Disciplines. 
But Link says the presence of the Confucius Institutes on university campuses is dangerous because it often limits academic freedom to discuss China's human rights issues. 
""It's induced self-censorship. That is, ‘We are going to give you these funds and you can invite speakers about China and the fund comes from Beijing and you know that and we know that.’ Now, as the director of a Confucius Institute, do you think, ‘Oh, I'll invite the Dalai Lama’ to speak? No.Of course you don't do that,"" Link said. 
But Jain said the UCLA Confucius Institute does not back away from touchy topics. 
""Whether it's artists that we present there who were active in sort of [an] anti-government movement or whether it's the screening of films that are maybe not officially approved by the government, we don't shy away from that, but what we always tell our colleagues in China is that we promise to always present everything in a fair and balanced way,"" said Jain. The Hollywood Sign is pictured Aug. 23, 2016, in Los Angeles. 
Entertainment industry 
In the past, Hollywood movies have been America's example of soft power. 
Last fall, 16 members of Congress wrote a letter to the Government Accountability Office to express national security concerns about the growing number of Chinese investments in the United States, including in the media and entertainment industry. 
""There is definitely a self-censorship. There is no doubt. I think the most obvious version of that was when self-censorship was not used and it really backfired,"" said Fenton. 
China is close to becoming the top global market at the box office and one that is much desired by Hollywood executives. If China closes that door to certain production studios in Hollywood, it will hurt financially. 
""It's a very large piece of the pie because it's roughly seven billion in dollars,"" Fenton said. ""If you're thinking like a business person, there is a certain creative vision you should have for the content you're making that if you want to call it self-censorship that's fine, or you call it just good business.""

Opposition Cries Foul as Pakistan Cracks Down on Social Media,"Opposition Cries Foul as Pakistan Cracks Down on Social Media share See comments ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN — 
Taha Siddiqui was relaxing in his living room with his son after work when he received a telephone call. On the other end of the line was a man claiming to be with the counterterrorism department of Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency. The man, who Siddiqui said identified himself as Nadeem Bodla, a deputy director of the counterterrorism wing in the FIA, told Siddiqui to ""drop everything"" and immediately report to his office. 
""It wasn't a courteous call,"" Siddiqui recalled. ""It was actually a call where he was talking from a point of authority. The tone was intimidating."" 
As a freelance journalist working with several international outlets, Siddiqui had been covering military affairs. 
His work had drawn attention in the past. Journalists who did not know him would sometimes call and urge him to rethink what he was filing, telling him authorities thought he was overstepping a boundary. 
This was the first time, though, that a government entity had officially approached him. The move concerned Siddiqui, who feared an arrest over ""illegal charges"" or the seizure of his equipment that could compromise his work and sources. 
Others questioned, too 
Others, namely political activists and opposition figures, had been called in for questioning based solely on their social media activity. FILE - Pakistani students of Islamic seminaries chant slogans during a rally in support of blasphemy laws, in Islamabad, Pakistan, March 8, 2017. Hundreds of students rallied in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, urging government to remove blasphemous content from social media and take stern action against those who posted blasphemous content on social media. 
One of them, Salar Sultanzai, tweeted from his handle @MeFixer that the FIA had told him to submit his cellphone and laptop for inspection. 
Siddiqui decided to file a petition of harassment in the Islamabad High Court. 
Interior Minister Ali Khan, in a news conference this week, maintained that the steps taken by the FIA were legal. The constitution, Khan said, barred anyone from demeaning the country's armed forces, its judiciary or its national religion, Islam. 
""I assure you no one is putting any restrictions on social media,"" Khan said, ""but a free-for-all social media is also unacceptable for a democracy."" 
He also said that only 27 social media identities and eight individuals had been identified for questioning and that no one had been arrested or harassed. 
Party activists feel targeted 
Opposition leader Imran Khan, whose PTI party held protests across the country this week, disagreed. He said the government was using excuses to crack down against activists from his party. Others from the party concurred. FILE - Human rights activists hold a picture of Salman Haider, who was missing, during a protest to condemn the disappearances of social media activists in Karachi, Pakistan, Jan. 19, 2017. Haider returned home, more than 20 days after disappearing in Islamabad. 
""This is all political,"" said Faisal Javed Khan of PTI. ""It's political victimization. They're picking our guys because they have been highlighting [Prime Minister] Nawaz Sharif's corruption."" 
Another PTI activist, Shahzad Waseem, said the crackdown went against the norms of freedom of expression. ""Unfortunately, the government in Pakistan is trying to curb the voice of civil society of Pakistan,"" he added. 
The current crackdown has revived memories of the disappearances this year of at least five bloggers. Many in the country blamed the intelligence agency ISI for picking them up for having criticized the military in their social media posts. 
A countrywide uproar led to their return, but they were afraid to speak up about what happened. Most of them and their families reportedly left the country soon afterward. At least one of them told the BBC he had been tortured for pleasure by a government institution linked to the military. 
Rules for social media use 
On Wednesday, Interior Minister Khan directed the relevant government departments to formulate a framework ""which ensures that social media is used as a medium to facilitate positive, constructive and healthy interactions … and not as a tool to propagate false information, pass defamatory comments, ridicule or humiliate sacred personalities, national institutions or jeopardizing social, religious and cultural values of any community."" 
He has also requested that the national assembly speaker reach out to all political parties over this issue. 
Meanwhile, Siddiqui is waiting for his hearing next week to find out why he was approached over his journalistic work. Your opinion"

Trump's Budget Director: Health Care Bill Would Curtail Health Care Costs,"Trump's Budget Director: Health Care Bill Would Curtail Health Care Costs share See comments WASHINGTON — 
U.S. President Donald Trump's budget director told the Senate Budget Committee Thursday that Republican legislation aimed at revamping the nation's health care law would curtail the growth of health care costs. 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued a report Wednesday estimating the bill, which narrowly passed the House of Representatives earlier this month, would achieve $119 billion in savings over 10 years. 
Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told lawmakers that the bill would achieve savings through ""structural changes"" that would ""put the states much more in control over how they administer health care at the local level."" 
The savings would result from relaxing requirements on the quality of coverage insurers would have to provide and because of cuts in the number of people who would be covered under the current law's expansion of Medicaid, a state-based program for low-income people. 
Sanders critical of measure 
The measure was harshly criticized by independent Senator and former presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, who said the House bill is reflective of Trump's proposal to cut $3.6 trillion in government spending over the next decade, partially by cutting taxes for wealthy Americans. 
""If you are a member of the Trump family, you may receive a tax break of up to $4 billion,"" Sanders said. ""But if you are a child of a low-income family, you could well lose the health insurance you currently have through the children's health insurance program and massive cuts to Medicaid."" 
The CBO estimates 23 million Americans would lose health insurance over a 10-year period under the Republican health care bill. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, speaks at a Democratic National Committee rally, April 21, 2017, in Mesa, Arizona. 
Higher deductibles 
The CBO analysis gives the public an estimate of the impact the measure would have on health coverage, premiums and the nation's budget. In addition to pared down coverage, many consumers would face higher deductibles under the bill, which was narrowly approved 217-213 on May 4. 
Replacing the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, was a priority of Donald Trump during his presidential campaign, and of Republican lawmakers since its enactment in 2010. 
The CBO issued two reports on earlier versions of the Republican legislation, called the American Health Care Act, in March. Both concluded that the bill would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 24 million over a period of 10 years. 
The reports also projected the bill would increase premiums by an average of 15 to 20 percent over a 2-year period, but push them 10 percent lower than they would otherwise be by 2026. 
Some conservative and moderate Republican lawmakers abandoned their support for the measure and crafted new language for a revised bill that narrowly won House approval. 
More decisions for states 
The new provisions would allow states to permit insurance companies to increase premiums on some people with pre-existing conditions and waive the federal ""essential health benefits"" requirement. States also would get permission to allow insurers to charge higher premiums for older people. 
Democratic lawmakers have attacked the changes, maintaining they are designed to victimize people with serious health problems that require expensive medical care. 
The latest bill would cut taxes by about $1 trillion over a decade, mostly for higher income people and health insurers, the CBO said. It would replace former U.S. president Barack Obama's tax subsidies for health insurance consumers with tax credits based largely on age instead of income. Your opinion"

Without giving a timetable, they said about 50,000 fighters would be participating in the battle for the IS stronghold, with aerial support from the U.S.-led coalition. 
""Special experts from coalition countries are supporting the training with clothes, weapons and other equipment,"" Muhammad Fathi, an SDF commander, told VOA. 
The SDF is a loosely knit alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters that the U.S. sees as the most effective and reliable Syrian group fighting IS. The SDF has been closing in on Raqqa since November in a multiphased operation aimed at first isolating the city and then invading it. It recently claimed a major victory by seizing Syria's largest dam and Tabqa town, 50 kilometers west of Raqqa. 
Driving IS from Raqqa is a major priority for the U.S.-led coalition. The U.S. announced this month that it would provide Kurdish forces around Raqqa with small arms, machine guns, ammunition and armored vehicles to counter improvised explosive devices and construction equipment. Washington sees arming the Kurdish fighters as the easiest way to bring about Raqqa's downfall. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered an ""accelerated operation"" against Islamic State jihadists in Syria, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said last week. Mattis called it a ""tactical shift,"" saying the military would move away from operations designed to shove IS fighters out of seized locations, and instead focus on ""surrounding the enemy in its stronghold."" Raqqa, Syria 
Law and order 
Kurdish commanders told VOA that hundreds of fighters were enrolled in seven-day training courses that would prepare them not only for the invasion but also to maintain law and order in Raqqa after IS. The training sites are in several locations in northern Syria, they said. 
""Our goal has not been only to train fighters on how to take on the enemy, but also how to maintain stability in Raqqa,"" Fathi said. 
A VOA Kurdish service reporter visited one of the training sites this week in a schoolyard in the town of Ain Issa, 50 kilometers north of Raqqa, where 50 young men and women finished a training program that Kurdish commanders said was supervised by the U.S.-led coalition. The graduates were dressed in green uniforms and wore light blue arm patches bearing the image of an eagle with its wings spread and emblazoned with the words ""Raqqa Internal Security Force."" 
American military supervisors in the camp declined to comment. 
But analysts and Kurdish activists in northern Syria say Syrian forces need training on how to use the U.S.-supplied weapons. 
""The weapons are loaded on trucks and enter Rojava via the Iraqi Kurdistan's border on a daily basis,"" Jack Shahine, a Kurdish activist from northern Syria who monitors forces in the area, told VOA. 
Shahine said the weapons are taken to military bases in Minbaj, Kobani and the Hasakah region, where U.S. special forces are present as trainers. 
Turkish media reported that approximately 100 trucks have crossed into Syria from northern Iraq since May 15 with U.S. weapons. FILE - A Kurdish fighter from the People's Protection Units (YPG) carries his weapon as he walks the streets in the northeastern city of Hasaka, Syria, Aug. 21, 2016.

Turkey contends the SDF's Syrian Kurdish militia, known as the YPG, is a terrorist group affiliated with the outlawed PKK — the Kurdistan Workers' Party, a separatist group that has been battling the Turkish state for many years. 
Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon told VOA that the U.S. government had yet to provide weapons to the YPG. He said the weapons would be delivered to the YPG as necessary to accomplish specific military objectives in Raqqa. 
""We're not going to comment on every delivery, the contents of those deliveries or the locations of the equipment we're providing,"" Pahon said. To ""the extent possible, we want to keep IS in the dark to increase our partners' chances of a swift military defeat."" 
Stepped-up roles A senior Kurdish official who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity said coalition countries — mainly the U.S., France and Britain — had stepped up their advisory roles to the group.

""Anti-tank missiles and anti-armor missiles are the top of the wish list since Daesh [an IS acronym] was able to acquire tanks, Humvees and perhaps MRAPs when the Iraqi army collapsed,"" he told VOA, referring to a type of mine-resistant military vehicle.

Trump's Budget Director: Health Care Bill Would Curtail Health Care Costs,"WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump's budget director told the Senate Budget Committee Thursday that Republican legislation aimed at revamping the nation's health care law would curtail the growth of health care costs.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued a report Wednesday estimating the bill, which narrowly passed the House of Representatives earlier this month, would achieve $119 billion in savings over 10 years.
Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney told lawmakers that the bill would achieve savings through ""structural changes"" that would ""put the states much more in control over how they administer health care at the local level.""
The savings would result from relaxing requirements on the quality of coverage insurers would have to provide and because of cuts in the number of people who would be covered under the current law's expansion of Medicaid, a state-based program for low-income people.
Sanders critical of measure
The measure was harshly criticized by independent Senator and former presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, who said the House bill is reflective of Trump's proposal to cut $3.6 trillion in government spending over the next decade, partially by cutting taxes for wealthy Americans.
""If you are a member of the Trump family, you may receive a tax break of up to $4 billion,"" Sanders said. ""But if you are a child of a low-income family, you could well lose the health insurance you currently have through the children's health insurance program and massive cuts to Medicaid.""
The CBO estimates 23 million Americans would lose health insurance over a 10-year period under the Republican health care bill.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, speaks at a Democratic National Committee rally, April 21, 2017, in Mesa, Arizona.
Higher deductibles
The CBO analysis gives the public an estimate of the impact the measure would have on health coverage, premiums and the nation's budget. In addition to pared down coverage, many consumers would face higher deductibles under the bill, which was narrowly approved 217-213 on May 4.
Replacing the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, was a priority of Donald Trump during his presidential campaign, and of Republican lawmakers since its enactment in 2010.
The CBO issued two reports on earlier versions of the Republican legislation, called the American Health Care Act, in March. Both concluded that the bill would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 24 million over a period of 10 years.
The reports also projected the bill would increase premiums by an average of 15 to 20 percent over a 2-year period, but push them 10 percent lower than they would otherwise be by 2026.
Some conservative and moderate Republican lawmakers abandoned their support for the measure and crafted new language for a revised bill that narrowly won House approval.
More decisions for states
The new provisions would allow states to permit insurance companies to increase premiums on some people with pre-existing conditions and waive the federal ""essential health benefits"" requirement. States also would get permission to allow insurers to charge higher premiums for older people.
Democratic lawmakers have attacked the changes, maintaining they are designed to victimize people with serious health problems that require expensive medical care.
The latest bill would cut taxes by about $1 trillion over a decade, mostly for higher income people and health insurers, the CBO said. It would replace former U.S. president Barack Obama's tax subsidies for health insurance consumers with tax credits based largely on age instead of income."
Circus Program Teaches Teens Lessons in Balance and Life,"Circus Program Teaches Teens Lessons in Balance and Life   
School is not the only place children can learn -- they can also learn at the circus . 
The Trenton Circus Squad in the U.S. state of New Jersey teaches children between 12 and 17 years old new tricks and skills. The students learn to perform acrobatics , how to keep plates spinning in the air and how to ride a unicycle . 
At the same time, the students learn about children who are different from them. 
The circus program brings together children from low-income city neighborhoods and higher-income places. Performing together helps children develop friendships and connections. 
Zoe Brookes is the co-founder and executive director of the program. She says it helps change the negative image of teenagers in inner cities. 
“Performance is an essential part of what our teenagers experience. When they join after the first couple of weeks we expect them to get comfortable performing. And that may be doing something very simple like spinning a plate or doing a forward roll . But they learn that performing is a way of giving back to other people. You make somebody smile. And the whole community can feel joyful.” 
The children love the program. They say it is a second home for them and a place where they feel safe. 
Bilal Halley is a member of the Trenton Circus. 
“This is a really safe environment for me. Rather than going out on the streets, and just being exposed to many different things which are, like, either bad or good, but here it’s not no bad things -- just all good.” 
Brandon Coleman is also a member of the Trenton Circus. He says the program has helped him learn about new people. And, he says, it is teaching him to expect the best in everyone.

Opposition Cries Foul as Pakistan Cracks Down on Social Media,"ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN — Taha Siddiqui was relaxing in his living room with his son after work when he received a telephone call. On the other end of the line was a man claiming to be with the counterterrorism department of Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency. The man, who Siddiqui said identified himself as Nadeem Bodla, a deputy director of the counterterrorism wing in the FIA, told Siddiqui to ""drop everything"" and immediately report to his office.
""It wasn't a courteous call,"" Siddiqui recalled. ""It was actually a call where he was talking from a point of authority. The tone was intimidating.""
As a freelance journalist working with several international outlets, Siddiqui had been covering military affairs.
His work had drawn attention in the past. Journalists who did not know him would sometimes call and urge him to rethink what he was filing, telling him authorities thought he was overstepping a boundary.
This was the first time, though, that a government entity had officially approached him. The move concerned Siddiqui, who feared an arrest over ""illegal charges"" or the seizure of his equipment that could compromise his work and sources.
Others questioned, too
Others, namely political activists and opposition figures, had been called in for questioning based solely on their social media activity.
FILE - Pakistani students of Islamic seminaries chant slogans during a rally in support of blasphemy laws, in Islamabad, Pakistan, March 8, 2017. Hundreds of students rallied in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, urging government to remove blasphemous content from social media and take stern action against those who posted blasphemous content on social media.
One of them, Salar Sultanzai, tweeted from his handle @MeFixer that the FIA had told him to submit his cellphone and laptop for inspection.
Siddiqui decided to file a petition of harassment in the Islamabad High Court.
Interior Minister Ali Khan, in a news conference this week, maintained that the steps taken by the FIA were legal. The constitution, Khan said, barred anyone from demeaning the country's armed forces, its judiciary or its national religion, Islam.
""I assure you no one is putting any restrictions on social media,"" Khan said, ""but a free-for-all social media is also unacceptable for a democracy.""
He also said that only 27 social media identities and eight individuals had been identified for questioning and that no one had been arrested or harassed.
Party activists feel targeted
Opposition leader Imran Khan, whose PTI party held protests across the country this week, disagreed. He said the government was using excuses to crack down against activists from his party. Others from the party concurred.
FILE - Human rights activists hold a picture of Salman Haider, who was missing, during a protest to condemn the disappearances of social media activists in Karachi, Pakistan, Jan. 19, 2017. Haider returned home, more than 20 days after disappearing in Islamabad.
""This is all political,"" said Faisal Javed Khan of PTI. ""It's political victimization. They're picking our guys because they have been highlighting [Prime Minister] Nawaz Sharif's corruption.""
Another PTI activist, Shahzad Waseem, said the crackdown went against the norms of freedom of expression. ""Unfortunately, the government in Pakistan is trying to curb the voice of civil society of Pakistan,"" he added.
The current crackdown has revived memories of the disappearances this year of at least five bloggers. Many in the country blamed the intelligence agency ISI for picking them up for having criticized the military in their social media posts.
A countrywide uproar led to their return, but they were afraid to speak up about what happened. Most of them and their families reportedly left the country soon afterward. At least one of them told the BBC he had been tortured for pleasure by a government institution linked to the military.
Rules for social media use
On Wednesday, Interior Minister Khan directed the relevant government departments to formulate a framework ""which ensures that social media is used as a medium to facilitate positive, constructive and healthy interactions … and not as a tool to propagate false information, pass defamatory comments, ridicule or humiliate sacred personalities, national institutions or jeopardizing social, religious and cultural values of any community.""
He has also requested that the national assembly speaker reach out to all political parties over this issue.
Meanwhile, Siddiqui is waiting for his hearing next week to find out why he was approached over his journalistic work."
Africa Day Call to Action on South Sudan,"WASHINGTON — On Africa Day Thursday, about 300 young African leaders appealed to African heads of state to rescue South Sudan's 2015 peace agreement.
The Archbishop Tutu fellows said in a letter to the leaders that the conflict in South Sudan poses serious national security threats to neighboring countries.
""We, the Archbishop Tutu Fellows ['Tutu Fellows'], have been following the events unfolding in South Sudan with great dismay. We felt it incumbent upon ourselves to write and urge you, as neighbors and key members of regional blocs, to leverage your relationships with political and military leaders on all sides of the conflict in South Sudan to revive a political process and chart a way forward for the implementation of the August 2015 peace agreement,"" reads the letter addressed to ""Your Excellencies,"" the presidents of Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Rwanda, Nigeria, Namibia and Sudan.
Problem for all of Africa
Jackie Chimhanzi, chief executive officer for the African Leadership Institute in Johannesburg, South Africa, said South Sudan's conflict has become an Africa-wide problem.
""We felt that we needed to compel our leaders to act because we can talk about a peaceful Africa in 2063, yet we are not acting on South Sudan now, today,"" Chimhanzi said.
She said they purposely wrote the letter to the heads of neighboring countries because they have more at stake, adding, ""the atrocities, and the war, actually those things threaten to spill over into neighboring countries.""
Chimhanzi pointed out a number of Kenyan banks have had to shut down branches in South Sudan due to the insecurity, saying it's in their interest to work for peace in South Sudan.
The fellows urge the heads of state to deny South Sudan's political leaders access to amenities in their countries until they adhere to the peace deal.
Next generation of leaders
Chimhanzi said the Tutu fellows see themselves as Africa's next generation of leaders and therefore believe it's not right that ""our current leaders continue to not hold each other to account, to support behavior that they know are not correct.""
""It's time to be honest,"" Chimhanzi said, and to ""speak to power, because such behavior is really not progressing the continent.
""We are watching 3.9 [million] people being killed, 4.9 [million] people are food insecure right now, there's famine, women and children are being raped; it cannot be right.""
Chimhanzi calls the letter to the heads of state ""a call to action.""

Different Meanings of 'Make' in Everyday Speech,"Different Meanings of 'Make' in Everyday Speech   64 kbps | MP3 Pop-out player 
Imagine you are watching the 1991 American film City Slickers. It tells the story of an unhappy man and two of his friends. The men agree they need a short break from their day-to-day problems. So they decide to go on a trip to the southwestern United States. 
In the movie, you hear the following lines: 
""When you're a teenager, you think you can do anything – and you do. Your twenties are a blur . Thirties, you raise your family, you make a little money and you think to yourself, 'What happened to my twenties?"" 
Our report today is not about aging. Instead, it is about a strange verb: make. 
Have you ever wondered about the verb make? Have you noticed that it has different meanings in different situations? 
On Everyday Grammar, we will explore three meanings of the word make. We will learn how make has different meanings depending on the noun phrase that follows it in a sentence. 
The verb make 
Make is an irregular verb. Unlike many other verbs, the past tense is not formed by adding an – ed at the end. Instead, the past tense is made. 
The literal meaning of make is ""to produce or create something."" However, this meaning is not common in everyday speech. 
Instead, English speakers often use make to suggest different meanings. They show these meanings by using one of a number of noun phrases after the verb. 
Together, these make+noun phrase structures have an idiomatic meaning. In other words, the structure make+ a noun phrase often has a meaning other than what the individual words suggest. 
There are many different meanings of the structure make+ a noun phrase. 
Two grammar experts, Susan Conrad and Douglas Biber, have identified over one dozen commonly-used make + noun phrase expressions! 
Today, we will study three of them. These structures are all polite and can be used in almost any situation – at school, at work, or among friends and family. 
#1 Perform an action 
One common meaning of make is this: to perform an action. 
Make has this meaning when it is followed by a noun phrase such as the bed or a telephone call. 
Here are two examples. 
You might hear a parent tell a child, ""You need to make your bed ."" Or you might hear someone say, ""I would like to make a phone call ."" 
In both examples, the verb make suggests performing an action. So, when an English speaker says ""make the bed,"" he or she means to perform the action of straightening the bedcover and sheets. 
When someone says ""make a phone call,"" he or she means the act of going to the phone, calling the number, and speaking to another person. 
#2 Plan or decide to do something 
A second meaning of the verb make is to plan or decide to do something. Make has this meaning when followed by a noun phrase such as an appointment , plans to , or a decision to. 
Imagine you hear this short phone call: 
Person 1: Good afternoon, this is Doctor Smith's office. 
Person 2: Good afternoon. I would like to make an appointment with Dr. Smith. 
Person 1: I'm sorry, he's not available until Friday. Would you like to make an appointment f or this Friday? 
Person 2: I don't think that will work – I've already made plans to go out of town! 
In the exchange, you heard two examples of make+a noun phrase. The words ""make an appointment"" mean to plan to meet with another person. 
When the speaker says, ""I've already made plans to go out of town,"" what she means is that she has already decided to do something – go out of town. 
You will hear this structure often in other situations – such as in a news report or on a television show. Almost every day, news agencies report, ""The president has made a decision to… "" or ""The committee has made plans to...."" 
Now you know that they have the basic meaning of planning or deciding to do something. 
#3 Earn money 
A third common meaning of make is this: to earn money. Make has this meaning when followed by noun phrases such as a living , money , or a profit . 
So, for example, a student might say, ""Now that I've finished school, I have to make a living ."" A businessperson might explain to a financial specialist, ""My business made a profit last year."" 
In both cases, make means the act of earning money . 
There was an example of this meaning at the beginning of our report. 
""When you're a teenager, you think you can do anything – and you do. Your twenties are a blur. Thirties, you raise your family, you make a little money and you think to yourself, 'What happened to my twenties?"" 
What can you do? 
Now that you have learned about a few meanings of the verb make, you will have to make an attempt to learn a few other possible meanings of it. 
The next time you are watching an American film or television broadcast, try to find examples of make+ a noun phrase. 
Ask yourself how the speakers are using make, and what nouns or noun phrases go with the verb. 
Learning these idiomatic meanings of make is not easy. However, with training and effort, you can make progress .

Gaining Political Advantage Through Redistricting,"Gaining Political Advantage Through Redistricting share

Americans have been fighting over how to create congressional districts since 1789. 
That was when James Madison was elected to the House of Representatives although his Virginia district was created to give his opponent the advantage . Madison went on to become president of the United States, as did his opponent in that election, James Monroe. 
On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court released a decision in the latest congressional redistricting dispute. 
Redistricting is the process of redefining congressional districts on a map. Voters within each district elect a representative to the U.S. Congress. 
The court rejected two congressional districts in the state of North Carolina. The court said race played too large a part in how the districts were created. 
More African-American voters were added to both districts, making them majority black. Those disputing the redistricting said the result weakened black voting strength in other parts of North Carolina. 
It happens every 10 years 
Every 10 years the U.S. government carries out a census that counts the number of people living in all 50 states. 
After the census, each state develops new district lines for the House of Representatives, and state legislatures, to reflect the new population numbers. 
Common Cause is an activist group that supports measures to have independent commissions create districts. 
That would be a change from the current system. Most states now permit the political party that controls state government to create district lines. That gives the majority party’s candidates an advantage, according to Common Cause. 
There are now more state governments controlled by Republicans than Democrats. The Brennan Center, a democracy and justice group in New York, says this has given Republicans an advantage. 
The group says the benefits provided Republicans are worth 16-17 seats to the current Republican majority in the 435-member House of Representatives. 
Like a salamander A salamander is photographed at the Farallones National Wildlife Refuge in California. 
​ 
Developing district lines to give one political party an advantage is known as gerrymandering . That term was created in 1812 to make fun of a congressional district, approved by Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry. 
Some said the 1812 Massachusetts district looked like a salamander, a lizard-like animal that lives in water and on land. 
Supreme Court Justice Elaine Kagan wrote the recent decision in the North Carolina redistricting case. She said states cannot make race a primary reason for creating district lines, as she said was the case in North Carolina. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan. 
Republicans, who controlled the redistricting process in North Carolina, said they were guided by politics, not race. 
Their goal, Republicans said in a legal paper, was to make strong Democratic districts “even stronger” so Republican candidates in nearby districts would do better. 
The Supreme Court may take up the question of how much politics can affect redistricting next year, said Justin Levitt. He is a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, California. 
“There's no other major Western democracy that lets incumbents draw their own district lines, as we do, and that's the source of a lot of the problems we encounter ,” he said. 
The Brennan Center for Justice said six states use independent commissions to create district lines. But most others let state legislators and governors create districts. 
Eric Holder is the former attorney general under President Barack Obama. He is now the leader of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which backed the legal challenge that led to Tuesday’s Supreme Court decision. 
“North Carolina’s maps were among the worst racial gerrymanders in the nation,’’ Holder said. 
Robin Hayes is chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party. 
Hayes complained that it is difficult for legislatures to create district lines, when courts "" constantly "" change rules ""from case to case, often after the fact.” 
The Supreme Court ruling criticized how North Carolina creates districts. But the two districts considered by the court were already changed, as a result of earlier court rulings. 
More and larger congressional districts 
The size of House of Representative districts has grown as America’s population has increased. 
In 1790, each of the 110 members of the House of Representatives represented about 34,000 residents. Today, there are 435 House members, with districts of about 711,000 people each. 
Congress is divided into two bodies -- the House of Representatives and the Senate. The number of House members in each state is based on population. 
In the Senate, each state has two senators, regardless of population. So California, with a population of 39.2 million, has the same number of senators as Wyoming, with about 585,000 residents.

A United States Navy ship has sailed near a Chinese-controlled coral reef in the South China Sea. 
The move was the first U.S. test to China’s territorial claims in the waterway since President Donald Trump took office. 
The guided missile destroyer USS Dewey came within 22 kilometers, or 12 nautical miles, of Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands. China claims Mischief and other reefs in the South China Sea as part of its territory. 
The United Nations defines territorial waters as extending up to 12 nautical miles from a state's coastline. 
Chinese officials have sent workers to expand and develop the coral reefs. Satellite images suggest China has set up military bases and sent weapons to some of the new, man-made islands. Chinese dredging vessels are purportedly seen in the waters around Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, May 21, 2015. 
The United States and other nations have criticized China for its island-building activities in the area. The disputed waterway is one of the world’s busiest shipping routes . 
Other countries with territorial claims in the South China Sea are the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. 
The U.S. military has carried out freedom of navigation operations in the area. They are designed to show military force and demonstrate support for free movement of shipping in international waters.​ 
U.S. forces completed at least four freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea in recent years. The last one took place in October 2016. 
A U.S. Defense Department spokesman said in a statement the latest action was a continuation of the operations. U.S. forces would keep operating in the South China Sea to “fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows,” the statement said. 
China’s Foreign Ministry protested the naval operation. A foreign ministry official told reporters the U.S. destroyer had "" trespassed "" near islands over which China has "" indisputable sovereignty .""He added that such patrols were ""very likely to cause unexpected sea and air accidents."" The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Dewey prepares for a replenishment-at-sea in the South China Sea. 
""We urge the U.S. to correct this mistake and stop taking further actions so as to avoid hurting peace and security in the region and long-term cooperation between the two countries,"" the official said. 
Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators urged President Trump to restart freedom of navigation operations. The senators described the South China Sea as critical to U.S. national security interests and to peace in the Asia-Pacific area. 
The appeal came after a meeting in the United States between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The U.S. president said the meeting helped them to develop friendly relations. The Trump administration has said it is seeking China’s help in dealing with the North Korean nuclear threat.

School is not the only place children can learn -- they can also learn at the circus . 
The Trenton Circus Squad in the U.S. state of New Jersey teaches children between 12 and 17 years old new tricks and skills. The students learn to perform acrobatics , how to keep plates spinning in the air and how to ride a unicycle . 
At the same time, the students learn about children who are different from them. 
The circus program brings together children from low-income city neighborhoods and higher-income places. Performing together helps children develop friendships and connections. 
Zoe Brookes is the co-founder and executive director of the program. She says it helps change the negative image of teenagers in inner cities. 
“Performance is an essential part of what our teenagers experience. When they join after the first couple of weeks we expect them to get comfortable performing. And that may be doing something very simple like spinning a plate or doing a forward roll . But they learn that performing is a way of giving back to other people. You make somebody smile. And the whole community can feel joyful.” 
The children love the program. They say it is a second home for them and a place where they feel safe. 
Bilal Halley is a member of the Trenton Circus. 
“This is a really safe environment for me. Rather than going out on the streets, and just being exposed to many different things which are, like, either bad or good, but here it’s not no bad things -- just all good.” 
Brandon Coleman is also a member of the Trenton Circus. He says the program has helped him learn about new people. And, he says, it is teaching him to expect the best in everyone.

Scientists looking at the first pictures of the planet Jupiter sent by the NASA probe Juno were shocked at what they saw: monster cyclones, hundreds of kilometers wide, tearing across the planet's north and south poles. 
The scientists said the poles are nothing like the planet's familiar placid and colorful equatorial region. This image made available by NASA on May 25, 2017, and made from data captured by the Juno spacecraft shows Jupiter's south pole. The oval features are cyclones, up to 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) in diameter. 
""That's the Jupiter we've all known and grown to love,"" Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute, an applied research and development organization in San Antonio, Texas, said in an article released Thursday in the journal Science . ""And when you look from the pole, it looks totally different. ... I don't think anybody would have guessed this is Jupiter."" 
Bolton called the findings ""Earth-shattering. Or, should I say, Jupiter-shattering.""

Different Meanings of 'Make' in Everyday Speech,"Different Meanings of 'Make' in Everyday Speech share

Imagine you are watching the 1991 American film City Slickers. It tells the story of an unhappy man and two of his friends. The men agree they need a short break from their day-to-day problems. So they decide to go on a trip to the southwestern United States. 
In the movie, you hear the following lines: 
""When you're a teenager, you think you can do anything – and you do. Your twenties are a blur . Thirties, you raise your family, you make a little money and you think to yourself, 'What happened to my twenties?"" 
Our report today is not about aging. Instead, it is about a strange verb: make. 
Have you ever wondered about the verb make? Have you noticed that it has different meanings in different situations? 
On Everyday Grammar, we will explore three meanings of the word make. We will learn how make has different meanings depending on the noun phrase that follows it in a sentence. 
The verb make 
Make is an irregular verb. Unlike many other verbs, the past tense is not formed by adding an – ed at the end. Instead, the past tense is made. 
The literal meaning of make is ""to produce or create something."" However, this meaning is not common in everyday speech. 
Instead, English speakers often use make to suggest different meanings. They show these meanings by using one of a number of noun phrases after the verb. 
Together, these make+noun phrase structures have an idiomatic meaning. In other words, the structure make+ a noun phrase often has a meaning other than what the individual words suggest. 
There are many different meanings of the structure make+ a noun phrase. 
Two grammar experts, Susan Conrad and Douglas Biber, have identified over one dozen commonly-used make + noun phrase expressions! 
Today, we will study three of them. These structures are all polite and can be used in almost any situation – at school, at work, or among friends and family. 
#1 Perform an action 
One common meaning of make is this: to perform an action. 
Make has this meaning when it is followed by a noun phrase such as the bed or a telephone call. 
Here are two examples. 
You might hear a parent tell a child, ""You need to make your bed ."" Or you might hear someone say, ""I would like to make a phone call ."" 
In both examples, the verb make suggests performing an action. So, when an English speaker says ""make the bed,"" he or she means to perform the action of straightening the bedcover and sheets. 
When someone says ""make a phone call,"" he or she means the act of going to the phone, calling the number, and speaking to another person. 
#2 Plan or decide to do something 
A second meaning of the verb make is to plan or decide to do something. Make has this meaning when followed by a noun phrase such as an appointment , plans to , or a decision to. 
Imagine you hear this short phone call: 
Person 1: Good afternoon, this is Doctor Smith's office. 
Person 2: Good afternoon. I would like to make an appointment with Dr. Smith. 
Person 1: I'm sorry, he's not available until Friday. Would you like to make an appointment f or this Friday? 
Person 2: I don't think that will work – I've already made plans to go out of town! 
In the exchange, you heard two examples of make+a noun phrase. The words ""make an appointment"" mean to plan to meet with another person. 
When the speaker says, ""I've already made plans to go out of town,"" what she means is that she has already decided to do something – go out of town. 
You will hear this structure often in other situations – such as in a news report or on a television show. Almost every day, news agencies report, ""The president has made a decision to… "" or ""The committee has made plans to...."" 
Now you know that they have the basic meaning of planning or deciding to do something. 
#3 Earn money 
A third common meaning of make is this: to earn money. Make has this meaning when followed by noun phrases such as a living , money , or a profit . 
So, for example, a student might say, ""Now that I've finished school, I have to make a living ."" A businessperson might explain to a financial specialist, ""My business made a profit last year."" 
In both cases, make means the act of earning money . 
There was an example of this meaning at the beginning of our report. 
""When you're a teenager, you think you can do anything – and you do. Your twenties are a blur. Thirties, you raise your family, you make a little money and you think to yourself, 'What happened to my twenties?"" 
What can you do? 
Now that you have learned about a few meanings of the verb make, you will have to make an attempt to learn a few other possible meanings of it. 
The next time you are watching an American film or television broadcast, try to find examples of make+ a noun phrase. 
Ask yourself how the speakers are using make, and what nouns or noun phrases go with the verb. 
Learning these idiomatic meanings of make is not easy. However, with training and effort, you can make progress .

Gaining Political Advantage Through Redistricting,"Gaining Political Advantage Through Redistricting share

Americans have been fighting over how to create congressional districts since 1789. 
That was when James Madison was elected to the House of Representatives although his Virginia district was created to give his opponent the advantage . Madison went on to become president of the United States, as did his opponent in that election, James Monroe. 
On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court released a decision in the latest congressional redistricting dispute. 
Redistricting is the process of redefining congressional districts on a map. Voters within each district elect a representative to the U.S. Congress. 
The court rejected two congressional districts in the state of North Carolina. The court said race played too large a part in how the districts were created. 
More African-American voters were added to both districts, making them majority black. Those disputing the redistricting said the result weakened black voting strength in other parts of North Carolina. 
It happens every 10 years 
Every 10 years the U.S. government carries out a census that counts the number of people living in all 50 states. 
After the census, each state develops new district lines for the House of Representatives, and state legislatures, to reflect the new population numbers. 
Common Cause is an activist group that supports measures to have independent commissions create districts. 
That would be a change from the current system. Most states now permit the political party that controls state government to create district lines. That gives the majority party’s candidates an advantage, according to Common Cause. 
There are now more state governments controlled by Republicans than Democrats. The Brennan Center, a democracy and justice group in New York, says this has given Republicans an advantage. 
The group says the benefits provided Republicans are worth 16-17 seats to the current Republican majority in the 435-member House of Representatives. 
Like a salamander A salamander is photographed at the Farallones National Wildlife Refuge in California. 
​ 
Developing district lines to give one political party an advantage is known as gerrymandering . That term was created in 1812 to make fun of a congressional district, approved by Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry. 
Some said the 1812 Massachusetts district looked like a salamander, a lizard-like animal that lives in water and on land. 
Supreme Court Justice Elaine Kagan wrote the recent decision in the North Carolina redistricting case. She said states cannot make race a primary reason for creating district lines, as she said was the case in North Carolina. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan. 
Republicans, who controlled the redistricting process in North Carolina, said they were guided by politics, not race. 
Their goal, Republicans said in a legal paper, was to make strong Democratic districts “even stronger” so Republican candidates in nearby districts would do better. 
The Supreme Court may take up the question of how much politics can affect redistricting next year, said Justin Levitt. He is a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, California. 
“There's no other major Western democracy that lets incumbents draw their own district lines, as we do, and that's the source of a lot of the problems we encounter ,” he said. 
The Brennan Center for Justice said six states use independent commissions to create district lines. But most others let state legislators and governors create districts. 
Eric Holder is the former attorney general under President Barack Obama. He is now the leader of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which backed the legal challenge that led to Tuesday’s Supreme Court decision. 
“North Carolina’s maps were among the worst racial gerrymanders in the nation,’’ Holder said. 
Robin Hayes is chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party. 
Hayes complained that it is difficult for legislatures to create district lines, when courts "" constantly "" change rules ""from case to case, often after the fact.” 
The Supreme Court ruling criticized how North Carolina creates districts. But the two districts considered by the court were already changed, as a result of earlier court rulings. 
More and larger congressional districts 
The size of House of Representative districts has grown as America’s population has increased. 
In 1790, each of the 110 members of the House of Representatives represented about 34,000 residents. Today, there are 435 House members, with districts of about 711,000 people each. 
Congress is divided into two bodies -- the House of Representatives and the Senate. The number of House members in each state is based on population. 
In the Senate, each state has two senators, regardless of population. So California, with a population of 39.2 million, has the same number of senators as Wyoming, with about 585,000 residents.
