Mike Rivero,US retrieving weapons from Kurds after ISIS defeat in Raqqa is ‘fairytale’,"US retrieving weapons from Kurds after ISIS defeat in Raqqa is ‘fairytale’ Published time: 23 Jun, 2017 15:36 Edited time: 24 Jun, 2017 15:36 Get short URL © Safin Hamed / AFP The US is supplying arms to the Kurds in Syria for its own goals, says investigative journalist Rick Sterling. Thinking it will be able to recover those weapons once ISIS is defeated is a fairytale, adds journalist Martin Jay. Trends Global terrorism , Islamic State , Syria unrest , Syria-Turkey , Turkey crackdown on Kurds 
The Turkish Defense Ministry said Thursday the US told Ankara it expects the return of weapons given to Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) located in Syria after ISIS is destroyed. According to the ministry, US Defense Secretary James Mattis also promised to give Turkey a list of weapons supplied to the YPG militia. 
Investigative journalist Rick Sterling says the purpose of Washington’s pledge is “to placate the Turks, who are angry the US started supplying weapons to the Kurds” in the SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces). 
Given the failed attempts to take back arms in Afghanistan and Libya, it’s improbable the US will be able to keep its promise and retrieve weapons from the Kurds, Sterling told RT. 
“It’s especially unlikely now this message, this communication from General James Mattis has been made public. It’s pretty certain the communication was supposed to be confidential, but now it’s been made public by the Turkish general. So it’s going to upset the Kurds and make it all the less likely that they could ever reclaim those weapons,” he said. ‘US-Turkish relations deteriorating rapidly’ (Op- Ed) https://t.co/v6yVjLzXqD — RT (@RT_com) June 17, 2017 
In Sterling’s view, the US is supplying the weapons for its own goals “which seem to be to break off a part of Syria and to allow the US to dominate a separate part of Syria...in violation of Syrian sovereign integrity.” 
But the fundamental question, the journalist said, “is what the US is doing sponsoring an army inside Syria to recapture Raqqa.” 
“Why aren't they working with the Syrian government to do that instead of shooting down the Syrian plane as they did just [on Sunday]?” 
“I think there are a lot of crosses and double-crosses going on. We see the contention, the conflict going on now between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Turkey is allying with Qatar. You’ve got the US, which is a NATO partner with Turkey, but which is allying with the Kurds. They’ve all got their own separate goals; they are all saying one thing, but doing something else. All of these countries are doing it in blatant violation of international law. That is why I say it is a kind of a falling out among thieves because they should be following international law, which says that they shouldn’t be in Syria in the first place without the invitation of the Syrian government. None of those countries have that invitation or authorization. That’s one element,” he said.

Another element, Sterling went on to say, is the situation in Raqqa. 
“There is a report of collusion between the Kurds and the US with ISIS, whereby they have allowed ISIS military forces to vacate Raqqa and head to Deir ez-Zor, which is in a precarious situation, because for two years you had the city of Deir ez-Zor and an airbase, and parts of that city controlled by Syrian forces and entirely surrounded by ISIS. If there is a huge flood of ISIS fighters, which are allowed to travel unimpeded from Raqqa to Deir ez-Zor, it’ll make it all the more precarious in Deir ez-Zor. If we take a very negative, but possibly realistic look at it, we would see that might be the US objective to see the Syrian Arab Army, which is holding out in Deir ez-Zor protecting the population – 100, 000 people – it is possible that the US in collusion is looking the other way, or explicitly allowing ISIS to move there, and they are thinking that ISIS may overrun the Syrian forces in Deir ez-Zor,” Sterling said.

Journalist Martin Jay says it is unrealistic to expect the US will be able to get the weapons supplied to the Kurdish militia back once the war is over. 
“It depends on whether you believe in fairytales or Father Christmas. I don’t imagine that those arms are going to be handed back. They might get a percentage of it back, but I think they’ll get a lot of excuses, a lot of farfetched stories about guns lost or destroyed in the confusion of war,” he told RT. 
The journalist also said the Kurdish question and who is arming them has become “paramount in the last few days with a new Saudi Crown Prince.” 
READ MORE: Hired gun: Is war with Iran now inevitable under new Saudi crown prince? 
“Prince Mohammad bin Salman has told the Kurds in no uncertain terms that if he doesn’t get what he wants in Qatar – which is for Turkish troops to be removed completely, he hinted, he said he might look at options on arming the Kurds themselves. So you have an incendiary situation with the Kurds in Northern Syria, which has got so much more complicated in just the last few weeks with the Qatar crisis emerging,” he said. “And America is again deliberating and not sure …where to place itself in, so it’s straddled both camps. There was a lot of confusion just a week ago from the White House between Trump and the Pentagon over the Qatar question.” The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

RT,RT - Daily news: Detroit judge blocks deportation of Iraqi Christians,"Detroit judge blocks deportation of Iraqi Christians Published time: 23 Jun, 2017 18:29 Get short URL Detroit, Michigan, June 21, 2017© Jim West / Global Look Press A federal court judge has temporarily halted the deportation of more than 100 Iraqi Christians living in the Detroit area who were detained in raids by federal agents. Many of them fear torture and possible death if sent back to Iraq. 
US District Judge Mark Goldsmith said in a written order on Thursday that deportation is halted for two weeks as he determines whether the court has jurisdiction. 
Judge Goldsmith agreed the Iraqis, many of them Christian, could face persecution in Iraq, and so they should be allowed to stay until the court can make a further ruling. Trump's deportation mania extends to Iraq's Chaldean Christians. Deportation could be a ""death sentence."" https://t.co/9SKej2BFwt pic.twitter.com/QSUJd72r8W — Kenneth Roth (@KenRoth) June 16, 2017 
Attorneys for 114 Iraqi immigrants and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Michigan cheered the judge’s decision, according to the Detroit News. 
In a statement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said it will comply with the order. 
One of the attorney's Clarence Dass told RT lawyers have 14 days to file individual motions for all of their clients and get hearings in the interim. 
The vast majority of the people rounded up in raids, Dass explained, left Iraq 20 or 30 years ago and lack fundamental documentation that would make them legitimate residents of Iraq, such as birth certificates and passports. 
The ACLU of Michigan had filed a class-action lawsuit on June 15 to halt federal immigration officials from deporting more than 100 Iraqi nationals rounded up by federal agents. The ACLU argued it’s illegal to deport the detainees without giving them an opportunity to prove they could face torture or death if returned to Iraq. Most of the 114 Iraqis are Chaldean Christians, but some are Shiite Muslims and converts to Christianity. https://t.co/vooAnU9qw5 — WISH-TV (@WISH_TV) June 23, 2017 
The ACLU also filed a motion asking the court for a restraining order of the people held in custody until it’s determined whether they are entitled to protection. 
Judge Goldsmith heard arguments on Wednesday. Goldsmith did not make a final determination on the lawsuit, which was filed against Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
Goldsmith said that ""the court is unsure whether it has subject-matter jurisdiction,"" according to Detroit News. 
Dass told RT the court fight is likely to be the first to resolve the issue of jurisdiction as there doesn’t appear be legal precedent. 
More than 114 Iraqis, many Chaldean Christians, were arrested by federal immigration officials in raids on June 11 in the Detroit metropolitan area. Read more Protesters block US deportation buses carrying Iraqi Christians (VIDEOS) 
The arrests sparked protests in Metro Detroit by supporters who say the Iraqis would face persecution in their homeland since many of them are Christians. Almost 200 Iraqi nationals with criminal records have been arrested recently nationwide by federal immigration agents. 
ICE has defended the arrests, saying the Iraqis arrested all had criminal backgrounds and final orders of deportation from an immigration judge. 
One of the questions is how deportation will work to a country that is embroiled in war, where towns like Mosul are occupied by Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL). 
“The biggest concern here is the vast majority of the Chaldeans, Syrians and Christians come from what is known as ISIS territory. The city of Mosul, which is the largest Christian village in Iraq, was the first raided by ISIS. Their Christian brethren have left these areas,” Dass told RT. “For them to return for sure will be to face discrimination, torture, if not the death penalty when they get there.” 
Dass said a lot of these people wear their Christian faith on their bodies in the form of tattoos, with scriptures on their wrists, or crosses on their forearms. 
“They are a very religious people.“ 
Dass said he had two clients that contacted him when the Trump administration first announced its immigration policy. That client base has ballooned to 23 since the raids. 
Dass said he was surprised the Chaldeans were targeted as a week before Congress had passed a resolution recognizing there was a genocide underway against Chaldeans, the Syrian Christians, and Christians in Iraq.

“Just one week prior our federal government declared religious discrimination against this group,” Dass remarked. “A week later they round up the same group and are attempting to send them back to the same place where genocide is occurring, so it was very ironic.” 
Chaldeans are an Iraqi indigenous community and speak Aramaic. The Chaldean Catholic Church is an Eastern Catholic Church and uses the East Syrian rite. 
The Chaldean Catholic community in Detroit dates back to the early 20th century. There are about 150,000 Chaldeans in the Detroit area, which is the largest Chaldean diaspora community living outside the Middle East, according to the Chaldean Community Foundation.

RT,RT - Daily news: 64% of US voters believe Trump-Russia investigations are damaging country – poll,"64% of US voters believe Trump-Russia investigations are damaging country – poll Published time: 23 Jun, 2017 17:58 Get short URL © Jonathan Ernst / Reuters The majority of American voters believe the investigations into Russia and President Donald Trump are hurting the country, and would like to see Congress focus on other matters, including healthcare and the economy, according to a newly-released poll. 
The Harvard-Harris poll, provided to The Hill , found that 64 percent of respondents believe the probes into President Trump and Russia are damaging the country. 
Fifty-five percent said they would rather Washington focus on other issues, while just 44 percent said the country should remain focused on the Russia investigations. 
Still, the majority of respondents (58 percent) said they are concerned about allegations of obstruction of justice against Trump, with the same number saying they're worried about possible ties between Trump and the Kremlin. Read more Trump suggests he bluffed about tapes to keep Comey honest 
When asked about the alleged collusion between Trump's administration and Moscow, 52 percent said they don't believe the president coordinated with the Kremlin to influence the 2016 election. However, 54 percent said they believe his associates may have done so. Despite many believing collusion may have occurred, 62 percent said there is currently no hard evidence to support the claims. 
An overwhelming majority (73 percent) said they're concerned that the Russia investigations have caused Washington to lose sight of the issues most important to them. Of those respondents, 81 percent identified as Republican, 74 percent as Independents, and 68 percent as Democrats. 
“While the voters have a keen interest in any Russian election interference, they are concerned that the investigations have become a distraction for the president and Congress that is hurting rather than helping the country, ” Harvard-Harris co-director Mark Penn said, as quoted by The Hill. “ Most voters believe that the president's actions don't rise to the level of impeachable offenses, even if some of them were inappropriate.” 
Meanwhile, 68 percent of respondents said they believe former FBI Director James Comey's claims that Trump asked him to drop an investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, despite Trump denying those claims. 
Fifty-eight percent said they believe Comey's memos about his private dealings with Trump are accurate, and 56 percent said they disapprove of Trump firing Comey. 
Even so, the majority of respondents(58 percent) believe that Trump's dealings with Comey do not constitute obstruction of justice. 
When asked about what Trump's fate should be, 45 percent said the investigations into the president should end with no action, while 41 percent said they should end in impeachment. Fourteen percent said the president should be censured by Congress. 
“Most voters believe that the president's actions don't rise to the level of impeachable offenses even if some of them were inappropriate, ” Penn said. “There does seem to be about 40 percent very dissatisfied with the president and looking to remove him from office if possible, but the majority of voters think that all of this is going nowhere.” 
Sixty-two percent said they believe there is a campaign to delegitimize Trump as president of the United States. Of those, 87 percent were Republicans, 63 percent were Independents, and 40 percent were Democrats. 
The Harvard-Harris poll surveyed 2,237 voters between June 19 and June 21, with a party affiliation breakdown of 35 percent Democrat, 29 percent Republican, 30 percent Independent, and 6 percent ""other.

,"Trump signs law to protect Veterans Affairs whistleblowers, expedite firings — RT America","Trump signs law to protect Veterans Affairs whistleblowers, expedite firings Published time: 23 Jun, 2017 15:58 Edited time: 23 Jun, 2017 16:36 Get short URL © Carlos Barria / Reuters President Donald Trump has signed a law protecting whistleblowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs and making it easier to fire problem employees. Trump campaigned on the platform of overhauling the agency serving US veterans. 
“For many years the government failed to keep its promises to our veterans,” who were put on secret waitlists, given wrong medication or bad treatment, Trump said, calling it “a national disgrace.” 
Outdated laws kept the government from holding accountable those VA employees who failed veterans, the president said, calling the new law “one of the largest reforms to the VA in its history.” Veterans affairs chief: 'Nothing makes me lose sleep more than the veterans we are losing to suicide,' https://t.co/uxQbu8iPgW — RT America (@RT_America) May 31, 2017 
“In a short time, we’ve already achieved transformative change at the VA, and believe me we’re just getting started,” Trump said. 
The 2017 VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act makes permanent the office Trump created by executive order to look into claims by agency whistleblowers and protect them from retaliation. 
“The administration is committed to ensuring the nation’s veterans have access to the care, services, and benefits they have earned,” the White House said in a statement about the legislation. “To achieve this goal, it is critical that employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are held to the highest performance standards, and that they are accountable when those standards are not met.” Read more Veterans Affairs chief vows to fix 'broken' agency procedures 
The new law strips away senior agency executives’ right to appeal disciplinary decisions to the government’s Merit Systems Protection Board, replacing it with an internal agency grievance process. It also allows the VA to take back bonuses paid to employees found guilty of misconduct, and prohibits employees who are appealing disciplinary decisions from being placed on paid administrative leave. 
VA Secretary David Shulkin complained about the existing disciplinary procedures in May, calling the agency’s accountability process “clearly broken.” 
Current rules require a 30-day waiting period before any disciplinary action, and the VA currently has 1,500 proceedings pending, Shulkin said. He cited the case of a psychiatrist who was caught watching pornography on his iPad while meeting with a veteran, but the agency can’t fire him for another month. In another case, a court forced the VA to hire back an employee who spent two months in jail for drunken driving. 
“I want to thank President Trump for his leadership and determination to fix the VA,” Shulkin said, also thanking the members of Congress for the bipartisan effort in getting the law passed.

The incident has raised questions about racism in policing. 
Officers were chasing three men in a stolen white sedan when the vehicle crashed on Wednesday night, forcing the three occupants to flee and sparking a shootout with police, according tp the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 
The St. Louis County Police Department said the car crashed happened near the intersection of Park Lane and Astra Avenue in the North Pointe neighborhood. 
Two officers, ""fearing for their safety,"" fired at the suspects, striking one in the ankle, according to a department summary of the shooting.

On hearing the gunfire, the off-duty police officer – who lived nearby – grabbed his service weapon and hurried out to help police at the scene. Initial reports suggested the wounded officer was shot during the gun battle, but it later turned out his wound came from a separate encounter. 
The 38-year-old, and an 11-year department veteran, was initially stopped by two uniformed cops and ordered to the ground before they recognized him, according to a department incident summary released on Thursday.

“We have a police officer standing in his own yard, who hears the commotion from the car crash on the block, comes out, and has a conversation with some of the officers on the scene who are pursuing the stolen car – and he winds up getting shot!” Rufus Tate Jr, the wound officer’s attorney, told KTVI-TV. 
“This happens to be the first time in the national discourse that we are aware of where a black professional law enforcement officer is shot and treated as an ordinary black guy on the street,” Tate said. “We can see this is a real problem.” 
The 36-year-old officer who fired the shot is an 8-year department veteran. Neither officer was identified by name. 
""In the police report, you have so far, there is no description of any threat he received. So we have a real problem with that,"" Tate said. ""But this has been a national discussion for the past two years that is there is this perception that a black man is automatically to be feared."" 
Seven officers involved in the incident were placed on administrative leave, as is department policy after a shooting. The department's Force Investigative Unit is looking into the incident. 
Two of the suspects were apprehended, while the third remains at large. 
Prosecutors charged Deandre Chaney and Cortney Smith, both 17, with seven counts of first-degree assault, seven counts of armed criminal action, felony fleeing, and tampering.

RT,California AG bans travel to 4 more states over LGBTQ discrimination,"California AG bans travel to 4 more states over LGBTQ discrimination Published time: 23 Jun, 2017 16:49 Get short URL © Lucy Nicholson / Reuters California is fighting intolerance by tightening the purse strings for state officials traveling to US states deemed to have enacted prejudicial laws. 
State employees, including staff from the University of California, have been banned from using public funding to travel to Alabama, Kentucky, South Dakota and Texas because of recent “discriminatory legislation.” 
The ban was announced on Thursday by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and is an extension to Assembly Bill No 1887 . Alabama, Kentucky, South Dakota & Texas join North Carolina, Kansas, Mississippi & Tennessee on prohibited list for state travel — Xavier Becerra (@AGBecerra) June 22, 2017 While DOJ works to protect the rights of all our people, discriminatory laws in any part of our country send all of us several steps back — Xavier Becerra (@AGBecerra) June 22, 2017 
The bill, approved in September 2016, is an attempt by California lawmakers to “avoid supporting or financing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.” 
It prohibits state agencies and departments from requiring staff members to travel to a state that, after June 26, 2015, has approved a law that “authorizes” discrimination of same-sex couples or other people on the basis of their sexual or gender orientation. 
“Our country has made great strides in dismantling prejudicial laws that have deprived too many of our fellow American of their precious rights. Sadly, that is not the case in all parts of our nation, even in the 21st century,” Becerra said. 
“While the California DOJ works to protect the rights of all our people, discriminatory laws in any part of our country send all of us several steps back. That’s why when California said we would tolerate discrimination against LGBTQ members of our community, we meant it.” 
California’s blacklist already includes Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and North Carolina, which was heavily criticized for a so-called ‘bathroom bill’ requiring schools to ensure students use toilet or changing facilities based on their ‘biological sex’. The measure was seen to be discriminatory towards transgender people.

RT,"Cargo ship that hit US destroyer near Japan was on autopilot, data shows","Cargo ship that hit US destroyer near Japan was on autopilot, data shows Published time: 23 Jun, 2017 16:31 Get short URL © JIJI PRESS / AFP The Philippines-flagged freighter that struck the USS Fitzgerald off the coast of Japan last week was on autopilot at the time, according to tracking data that emerged in the course of the investigation. The collision killed seven US sailors and injured three. 
While the US Navy’s investigation is ongoing, officials familiar with the preliminary results said the container ship ACX Crystal was under control of a computerized navigation system at 1:30 am local time on June 16, when the freighter broadsided the Fitzgerald about 64 miles off the coast of Japan. 
There were no crew members on duty in the pilot house of the Crystal at the moment the freighter collided with the Fitzgerald , the Washington Free Beacon reported. So far, the investigators have found no evidence the collision was deliberate. Read more 7 missing, at least 3 injured as US Navy destroyer crashes into trade ship off Japan coast 
The Navy investigators are now trying to determine why the Fitzgerald’ s radar and sensors did not detect the freighter in time to avoid the collision. 
The Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer is equipped with the AN/SPS-64 navigation radar and a commercial radar system. It also has a crew of nearly 300 sailors, and is required to maintain a watch on the bridge at all times. 
The Crystal, however, had a crew of about 20 at the time of the collision. Cargo ships like the Crystal are required to broadcast AIS location data, which should have been monitored by the Fitzgerald’ s crew. 
An analysis of that data by the private data analytics company Savi shows that the Crystal slowed down after the collision but continued sailing on its course for about 36 minutes, at which point it turned around and headed back to the collision site. The crash was officially reported at 2:20am local time, nearly an hour after the fact. 
""This shows the autopilot was engaged because nobody would power out of an accident with another ship and keep sailing back on course. It’s unthinkable,"" naval analyst Steffan Watkins told the Free Beacon. The fact that the merchant ship did not radio the Japanese Coast Guard for almost 30 minutes also suggests nobody was on the bridge at the time of the accident.

The freighter’s impact damaged the Fitzgerald ’s communication systems, forcing the crew to communicate by satellite-based cell phones. It also damaged the commanding officer’s stateroom and flooded one of the berthing compartments, causing seven sailors to drown.

RT,US releases photos showing ‘unsafe’ intercept by Russian jet over Baltic,"US releases photos showing ‘unsafe’ intercept by Russian jet over Baltic Published time: 23 Jun, 2017 16:26 Edited time: 23 Jun, 2017 16:27 Get short URL © U.S. European Command New photos released by United States European Command (EUCOM) show an Su-27 less than ten meters from a US surveillance aircraft, in one of just several close brushes between Russian and NATO forces to occur in the tense theater in the past several days. 
“A US RC-135U flying in international airspace over the Baltic Sea was intercepted by a Russian Su-27 Flanker June 19, 2017. Due to the high rate of closure speed and poor control of the aircraft during the intercept, this interaction was determined to be unsafe,” said a statement from EUCOM. © U.S. European Command 
However, the Russian Ministry of Defense offered a different version of Monday’s incident. 
“While being escorted, the RC-135 attempted to move closer to the Russian interceptor, making a provocative turn towards the Su-27,” the MoD said in a statement. © U.S. European Command 
Moscow said its own flights are conducted “in strict compliance with international regulations,” complaining that NATO forces have launched more than 15 spy plane flights “in the immediate vicinity of Russia’s airspace in the previous week.” A second RC-135U had to be intercepted just ten minutes after the incident featured in the latest photos, the ministry said. © U.S. European Command 
US media reported that, since the beginning of June, there have been over 35 interactions between Russian and NATO planes and ships, though most have been routine and not designated as “unsafe,” as EUCOM branded Monday’s intercept. © U.S. European Command 
The most notable encounter occurred on Wednesday, when an F-16 was scrambled to intercept three Russian planes, including one carrying Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, with NATO sources claiming the “aircraft did not identify themselves or respond to air traffic control.” 
A video filmed by a Russian TV crew from onboard a passenger plane shows a Russian Su-27 warding off an intercepted F-16 by showing that it was armed. The American plane subsequently retreated. 
The defense minister was visiting Kaliningrad, Russia’s westernmost enclave that has become a flashpoint for Russia-NATO tensions. Nuclear-capable Iskander missiles were deployed there by Russia last year. Several Su-34 jets beefed up Shoigu’s escort for his return trip, which saw several NATO planes tracking the planes from some distance away.

RT,"Trump signs law to protect Veterans Affairs whistleblowers, expedite firings","Trump signs law to protect Veterans Affairs whistleblowers, expedite firings Published time: 23 Jun, 2017 15:58 Edited time: 23 Jun, 2017 16:36 Get short URL © Carlos Barria / Reuters President Donald Trump has signed a law protecting whistleblowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs and making it easier to fire problem employees. Trump campaigned on the platform of overhauling the agency serving US veterans. 
“For many years the government failed to keep its promises to our veterans,” who were put on secret waitlists, given wrong medication or bad treatment, Trump said, calling it “a national disgrace.” 
Outdated laws kept the government from holding accountable those VA employees who failed veterans, the president said, calling the new law “one of the largest reforms to the VA in its history.” Veterans affairs chief: 'Nothing makes me lose sleep more than the veterans we are losing to suicide,' https://t.co/uxQbu8iPgW — RT America (@RT_America) May 31, 2017 
“In a short time, we’ve already achieved transformative change at the VA, and believe me we’re just getting started,” Trump said. 
The 2017 VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act makes permanent the office Trump created by executive order to look into claims by agency whistleblowers and protect them from retaliation. 
“The administration is committed to ensuring the nation’s veterans have access to the care, services, and benefits they have earned,” the White House said in a statement about the legislation. “To achieve this goal, it is critical that employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are held to the highest performance standards, and that they are accountable when those standards are not met.” Read more Veterans Affairs chief vows to fix 'broken' agency procedures 
The new law strips away senior agency executives’ right to appeal disciplinary decisions to the government’s Merit Systems Protection Board, replacing it with an internal agency grievance process. It also allows the VA to take back bonuses paid to employees found guilty of misconduct, and prohibits employees who are appealing disciplinary decisions from being placed on paid administrative leave. 
VA Secretary David Shulkin complained about the existing disciplinary procedures in May, calling the agency’s accountability process “clearly broken.” 
Current rules require a 30-day waiting period before any disciplinary action, and the VA currently has 1,500 proceedings pending, Shulkin said. He cited the case of a psychiatrist who was caught watching pornography on his iPad while meeting with a veteran, but the agency can’t fire him for another month. In another case, a court forced the VA to hire back an employee who spent two months in jail for drunken driving. 
“I want to thank President Trump for his leadership and determination to fix the VA,” Shulkin said, also thanking the members of Congress for the bipartisan effort in getting the law passed.",english,,,"trump , ",,"david shulkin , donald trump , shulkin , ","america , va , us , ",,,,"congress , merit systems protection board , white house , va , carlos barria / reuters , department of veterans affairs , ",http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR3OSYnYmcftMxzIJK0aAEzrs6C_c8gbysLIStetYXo8BUlI7Qi0YHzPC6Az.XkjrCyBuSE1bGfYg--,"Trump signs law to protect Veterans Affairs whistleblowers, expedite firings",http://www.rt.com/rss/usa/,RT America,2017-06-23T23:58:00.000+03:00,0,1,news,rt.com,US,https://img.rt.com/files/2017.06/article/594d3f44c461887d788b4627.jpg,5,
RT,London tower block to be evacuated over Grenfell cladding fears - Camden council,"— Camden Council (@camdentalking) June 23, 2017 
“Today the London Fire Brigade completed a joint inspection of the blocks with Camden Council technical experts. Together we decided that the Taplow block needs to be temporarily decanted while we undertake urgent fire safety works so that residents can be fully assured of their safety,” Gould said earlier on Friday evening. 
The decision to evacuate all five tower blocks at Chalcots estate comes after a public meeting on Thursday in which residents shared their fears over the safety of the tower buildings following the Grenfell Tower fire. 
Gould said works to rectify the cladding issue will take three to four weeks. 
“We realise that this is hugely distressing for everyone affected and we will be doing all we can, alongside the London Fire Brigade and other authorities, to support our residents at this difficult time,” Gould continued. 
“The Grenfell fire changes everything – we need to do everything we can to keep residents safe.” 
The council was the first in London to say it will be removing cladding from buildings deemed unsafe and earlier accused a contractor of fitting flammable materials below the requested standard. 
The devastating Grenfell fire was started by a faulty fridge, but subsequent testing showed that the building’s cladding and insulation failed safety tests. The cladding also aided the rapid spread of the fire, authorities suspect.

RT,Mexico v Russia: Hosts face crunch Confed Cup match in battle for semifinal spot,"Mexico v Russia: Hosts face crunch Confed Cup match in battle for semifinal spot 23 Jun, 2017 17:48 Get short URL https://on.rt.com/8fuk / Sputnik 
Hosts Russia go into their final 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup Group A match against Mexico on Saturday in Kazan knowing that only a victory will guarantee a semifinal spot in the tournament. 
Never before has a host nation failed to reach at least the Confed Cup semifinal stage, but anything less than three points at the riverside Kazan Arena in Russia’s Republic of Tatarstan will mean Russia will crash out should Portugal likely beat New Zealand in St. Petersburg. 
Russia currently sit third in Group A with three points courtesy of their 2-0 win over New Zealand in the tournament’s opening game in St. Petersburg. 
However, Sbornaya’s 1-0 defeat against European champions Portugal in their second group game in Moscow on Wednesday, coming by way of a Cristiano Ronaldo header, means they will definitely qualify only if they beat Mexico. Read more Russia 0-1 Portugal: Ronaldo gives European champs the lead in Moscow Confed Cup clash 
Portugal’s opening day draw with Mexico in Kazan, and Mexico’s narrow win over New Zealand in Sochi, means the two teams are the joint group leaders and level on four points, with only the group winners and runners-up advancing to the semifinal stage. 
With that in mind, Russia manager Stanislav Cherchesov may ditch the defensive 5-4-1 approach that proved ineffective versus Portugal and revert to the 4-4-2 formation that brought victory against New Zealand, where Dmitry Poloz partnered Fedor Smolov in attack. 
For Mexico, their fans have bemoaned manager Juan Carlos Osorio’s rotation system leading up to and during the tournament, believing it hinders the formation of a cohesive starting 11. 
The Colombian’s much-criticized policy saw eight changes lead to a drab performance against New Zealand in Sochi on Wednesday, when El Tri went 1-0 down and were outplayed in a disjointed first-half performance before battling back to win 2-1. 
However, his system does mean that several key players will be fully fit and rested for the game against Russia. Carlos Vela, Andres Guardado, Miguel Layun, Jonathan dos Santos, and danger man Javier ‘Chicharito’ Hernandez will all have benefitted from their midweek rest. 
Record scorer Hernandez is likely to spearhead the attacking line for Mexico in a 4-3-3 formation of a lineup that will more closely resemble the one that faced Portugal.

He will possibly partnered by 21-year-old Hirving ‘Chucky’ Lozano, who this summer secured a move to Dutch side PSV Eindhoven but is yet to make an appearance at this tournament. 
While Ronaldo is officially the world’s best player, Russia’s inexperienced backline were badly exposed against Portugal and could come underdone again if they are forced into facing Mexican pressure without any outlet of their own to press forward. 
A draw for Russia could be enough, although they would then be relying on New Zealand to pull off a seismic footballing shock and beat Portugal by a hefty goal margin. 
Russia will surely want to be the masters of their own fate and take the game to Mexico in search of a win. The home fans would expect nothing less.

“I’ve never seen anything like this. There are thousands of them!” says an astonished oil rig worker, who did not wish to identify himself, during a minute-long video that was sent to the Russian explorer and travel writer Sergey Dolya, who posted it on his blog. © Sergey Dolya / YouTube 
Harp seals migrate annually between their birthing and feeding grounds and the Arctic, where they spend the summer, often traveling in excess of 4,000 km in large colonies. 
But their appearance around the colossal platform – which is actively pumping oil and receiving docking tankers and oil ships – is a surprise, as the animals are thought to be put off by industrial vibrations and the noise and bustle of human activity. © Sergey Dolya / YouTube 
“The seals are very lazy and do not desire to move away from the path of the ship. There must be something attracting them here,” says the off-screen videographer in the undated footage. “This is the rig’s environment – with a herd of complimentary animals.” Read more Cold Rush 
In the video, the animals, which can live for up to 35 years in the wild, are seen diving under the thinning ice, and into the water, in which they can spend as much as fifteen minutes hunting their prey before they need to surface. 
Captains of ships operating in the Arctic have protocols for avoiding seals, who can suffer not just impact death, but traumatic displacement if an icebreaker plows through their habitat. This is less of an issue with the stationary platform though, which boasts that it has had zero impact on the environment, with all pollutants and waste stored and ferried back to the mainland. 
Despite being subjected to some of the most high-profile protests conducted by Greenpeace, the platform has operated without any high-profile hitches since oil was first extracted in 2014, and is shutting down for three months this summer for a planned upgrade. 
The Prirazlomnaya platform, which cost the state-run Russian giant Gazprom more than $1 billion to build and install, is a landmark project in Arctic oil exploration, a stated priority for both company and country.

RT,Paracetamol use in pregnancy could inhibit masculinity & dampen sex drive of male offspring – study,"Paracetamol use in pregnancy could inhibit masculinity & dampen sex drive of male offspring – study Published time: 23 Jun, 2017 17:21 Get short URL © 003 David Devins / Global Look Press Using paracetamol during pregnancy could lead to inhibited masculinity and a flaccid sex drive for male offspring during adult life, according to new research from the University of Copenhagen. 
In male fetuses, the painkiller lowers production of the primary male sex hormone, testosterone, which can damage the development of male behavior, warns a study published in the journal of the Society for Reproduction and Fertility. 
“We have demonstrated that a reduced level of testosterone means that male characteristics do not develop as they should. This also affects sex drive,” said study author David Mobjerg Kristensen 
Trials carried out on mice found that those exposed daily to acetaminophen while in the womb were unable to copulate in the same way as the control rodents. Read more ‘Deadly mess’: Ohio sues 5 pharma companies over opioid crisis 
“Male programming had not been properly established during their fetal development and this could be seen long afterwards in their adult life. It is very worrying,” Kristensen said . 
The specific masculine traits considered by the researchers were aggressiveness to other male mice, the ability to copulate, and the need to mark territory. 
The rodents that were subject to paracetamol at the prenatal stage reacted significantly more passively than those who were not. They did not attack other males, were unable to copulate, and behaved more like female mice when it came to urinary territorial marking, the scientists noted. 
“The area of the brain that controls sex drive – the sexual dimorphic nucleus – had half as many neurons in the mice that had received paracetamol as the control mice,” study author Professor Anders Hay-Schmidt said. 
“The inhibition of testosterone also led to a halving of the activity in an area of the brain that is significant for male characteristics,” he said. 
Though the dosage administered to the mice was very close to the recommended dosage for pregnant women, the scientists say the same trials cannot be undertaken on humans due to the potential “harmful effects.”

While this research focused on the effects of paracetamol on male fetuses, another paper from 2016, again involving Kristensen, showed that female mice had fewer eggs in their ovaries if their mothers took paracetamol during pregnancy. This led to the mice becoming infertile more quickly. 
Previous studies also noted that taking the medication during pregnancy can increase the risk of male infants being born with malformed testicles. 
Researchers say people should take the medicine if necessary, but need to be aware of the potential side effects. They advised pregnant women with any concerns to contact their GP.

“When he found out there may have been tapes out there, I think his story may have changed,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News. 
On May 11, shortly after Trump abruptly fired him, the former FBI director had a friend leak to the New York Times a portion of a conversation he said he had with Trump. The next day Trump tweeted, “James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! — Donald J.

For over a month, the president kept everyone guessing, refusing to answer whether or not the tapes existed. 
Trump tweeted Thursday he doesn’t have any tapes of his conversations with the former FBI director.

On June 8, Comey testified in Congress that he felt something inappropriate was happening when the president told him, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy,” referring to an FBI investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Many Democrats have accused Trump of obstruction of justice for the perceived request and for Comey’s firing. 
However, when asked during the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing if Trump “at any time” asked him “to stop the FBI investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 US elections,” Comey replied: “Not to my understanding, no.”

The cache provides insight into the operations of a special investigative team nicknamed ‘Department 50’, set up in 1942 to track down a group of spies with allegiances to Nazi Germany.

Now publicly accessible via Chile’s National Archives , the historical material reveals that clandestine Nazi groups were at work within the South American nation during the war. 
Launched by then-director of Chile’s police force, Jorge Garreton, ‘Department 50’ has been hailed in Chile as instrumental in clamping down on paramilitary Nazi groups. The secretive police unit was successful in unearthing spy cells monitoring allied shipping.

Dating from the early ‘40s, the newly available government documents also include reports on how Chilean investigators foiled Nazi plans to bomb parts of the country’s mining network. 
The suspects movements, interrogation files and photographs of Nazi meetings also make up the archive material. 
Images from between 1937-1944, and reportedly taken in the south of Chile, depict Nazi supporters attending summits and carrying out training drills in the countryside. 
One picture shows a group of people performing the ‘Seig Heil’ salute before a photograph of German dictator Adolf Hitler. The flag of Chile can be seen in the background hanging alongside a Nazi swastika and a banner pledging ‘sacrifice’ to the people of Germany. 
In a ceremony on Thursday, current director general of Chile’s police force, Hector Espinosa, praised those who helped stamp out the spread of Nazi influence.

RT,Cops 101: New Jersey wants to teach kids how to deal with police,"Cops 101: New Jersey wants to teach kids how to deal with police Published time: 23 Jun, 2017 20:24 Edited time: 23 Jun, 2017 20:24 Get short URL © Michael Kooren / Reuters A proposed new bill passed by the New Jersey Assembly requires the state’s school districts to teach children how to interact with law enforcement from kindergarten through to grade 12. 
""The number of police related shootings around the nation have created a mistrust of police in many communities. This can help rebuild the trust that is essential for law enforcement to work,"" said the bill's primary sponsor, New Jersey Assemblywoman Sheila Oliver. 
The proposed legislation, which has yet to be voted on by the state’s Senate, says students must be provided with information on “an individual’s responsibilities to comply with a directive from a law enforcement official; and an individual’s rights under law in interacting with a law enforcement official.” 
While proponents of the new measure see it as a way to lower the rates of police shootings and brutality, its critics contend that the bill puts undue responsibility on individuals for their safety during interactions with law enforcement. This is completely mindless. Children are not the issue. The police are the ones who don't know how to interact. — Dalibor Živković (@zivkovic_bre) June 23, 2017 
""This legislation does not empower young people, especially those living in Brown and Black communities. Instead, it empowers law enforcement by allowing them to continue to evade accountability for abuse and misconduct while forcing the burden on the public,"" said teacher and activist Zellie Imani. 
Assemblywoman Sheila Oliver defended the program by saying it’s about preparing the children rather than placing undue responsibility on them. 
The legislation will not become law until passed by the senate. 
A number of states proposed similar programs amid numerous killings at the hands of police in the US which many deem could have been avoided. 'Race catastrophe': Twitter calls for #JusticeforPhilando after cop acquitted https://t.co/opXYOT5DtB 
A new law passed in Texas already mandates schools to teach students how to interact with police officers. 
Earlier this week, Seattle Police shot and killed Charleena Lyles after she called them. Police said the woman brandished a knife. Lyles was pregnant and had her children in the apartment when the officers entered her home.
