A man wearing clown makeup and spiked gloves is accused of stabbing a man to death outside a taco restaurant in Denver. Christian Lee Gulzow, 36, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder for allegedly stabbing Brian Lucero, 29, to death, the Denver Post reported.
Gulzow allegedly attacked Lucero outside Torchy’s Tacos on West 11th Avenue and Broadway after he got into an argument with the victim.
Lucero died of a stab wound, according to the Denver coroner’s office.
Witnesses say a man wearing white clown makeup with black streaks on his face threatened the victim with his bladed glove outside a convenience store.
Police say the blades on each finger of the glove were two-to-three inches in length.
The victim tried to dodge Guzlow’s punches until the victim punched the suspect, according to a police report. The suspect reportedly yelled at the victim, the victim ran down an alley, and the suspect followed him to Torchy’s.
Police later found the victim in the parking lot of the taco restaurant with his throat stabbed, KTLA reported. The victim later died at a hospital.
Police used surveillance footage to track down a man riding a scooter who matched the suspect’s description and saw the man throw something into the bushes.
They later discovered that the object was a knife, according to the police report.
Police found the man, whom they identified as Guzlow, covered in blood and took him into custody.
Guzlow told police that Lucero threatened him, attacked him, and stole his scooter, according to court records.
The suspect said Lucero may have fallen onto one of his spiked wrist bracelets and that he may have cut him while he used his “clawed glove” to jab him, according to Guzlow’s account of the incident to police.
VICE reports that Guzlow is a local death metal vocalist who posts videos and photos of himself wearing makeup and gloves with pointed fingertips online, which match witnesses’ descriptions of the man who allegedly murdered Lucero.
Guzlow’s extensive criminal history includes convictions for domestic violence, assault, and using deadly weapons.

A Wisconsin man who falsely claimed to be a Navy SEAL who served in Vietnam and was wounded four times has been sentenced to four years behind bars. Kenneth E. Jozwiak, 68, pleaded guilty to theft, faking paperwork in order to obtain benefits meant for veterans, obstruction of justice, and lying to investigators, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.
Prosecutors say Jozwiak submitted a false discharge certificate saying he served as a Navy SEAL from 1965 to 1968, receiving Bronze Star and Purple Heart awards for his service.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the northern district of Ohio, however, said all the awards, including the four Purple Heart awards for injuries suffered in combat, were false.
Jozwiak did serve in the military, but he only served one year- from 1967 to 1968- out of a four-year enlistment and did not serve overseas.
Jozwiak has a lengthy rap-sheet that includes over 120 convictions related to theft since 1975, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney David Toepfer.
Toepfer said Jozwiak went to great lengths to promote this falsehood.
“He was particularly public in how he did it,” Toepfer said. “He went as far as accompanying a child to an elementary school and representing himself as a Navy SEAL there and as having received all of these awards.”
Court documents say it was his stepson’s school. Toepfer said the event was similar to a “take a veteran to school” event.
Before the VA inspector general investigated, Jozwiak received nearly $2,300 in VA pension benefits in 2014.
“I never used that for anything, nothing. Never have,” Jozwiak said when investigators confronted him with the false paperwork, according to the grand jury indictment.
Jozwiak is not the only person who has faked his military service to get benefits.
Earlier in May, a former southern California Marine was sentenced to 21 months in prison for faking a combat injury and falsely claiming that he was awarded a Purple Heart.
The problem has become so widespread, that one filmmaker decided to create a film exposing the problem called “Stealing Valor,” which will be screened at the GI Festival in Washington, D.C. on May 28.

A father in San Antonio, Texas, is in the Bexar County jail after his daughter was caught researching porn on the internet at her school. She said she was researching “what her dad does to her at night.” Bexar County sheriff’s deputies arrested 31-year-old Anthony Garay after his nine-year-old daughter told officials at Elk Elementary School her father had been sexually abusing her for over a year. Teachers at her school caught her looking up pornography on one of the school’s iPads. When they asked what she was doing, the little girl replied she was searching for “what her dad does to her at night.” She said her father never lets her sleep, the Daily Mail reported .
School officials immediately contacted child services who then interviewed the girl. Officials contacted police who investigated and obtained a warrant for his arrest.
Investigators reported the girl said Garay sexually assaults her “all the time at night,” the San Antonio Express-News reported . They said the man has also been allegedly sexually assaulting the little girl’s sister as well. The local newspaper did not report the relationship between Garay and the two girls. They referenced the man as “a relative.”
Reports indicate CPS investigated the San Antonio man previously for “sexual abuse of two relatives,” the Express-News reported.

A Tweet quotes Department of Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly saying a Border Patrol agent died last night after being stabbed in the face by a cartel member. Huffington Post politics and immigration reporter Elise Foley Tweeted on Thursday, “DHS Secretary John Kelly says a CBP officer died last night after being stabbed in the face by a cartel member.”

This was followed shortly by a Tweet from U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Twitter account stating that Border Patrol Agent Isaac Morales had died. “CBP mourns the loss of USBP Agent Isaac Morales. Our thoughts are with his family, friends, and fellow agents during this difficult time—KM,” the Tweet states.

A statement from the El Paso Police Department obtained by Breitbart Texas states the incident began on May 20 when off-duty Agent Morales and his girlfriend walked to their car from a bar they attended. The suspect, later identified as Hisaias Justo Lopez, 39, walked up to the couple, and another couple they were walking with and began an unprovoked confrontation. Morales identified himself to Lopez as a Border Patrol agent. The suspect then pulled a knife and stabbed Morales, Sgt. Enrique Carrillo wrote in a statement. Lopez reportedly fled and Morales pursued him, along with his friend and other witnesses.
Suddenly, Lopez turned and stabbed Morales in the face, Carillo stated. Witnesses eventually tackled Lopez and held him for police.
Emergency medical personnel transported Morales to an area hospital where they listed him in critical condition. Morales died from his wounds on Thursday.
Jail officials told Breitbart Texas Lopez is a U.S. citizen, born in Modesto, California.
Lopez is being held in the El Paso County Detention Facility on a $2 million bond, officials stated. He is charged with murder. Officials stated Lopez is being held in an isolation cell, meaning he is in lockdown 23 hours per day.
Breitbart Texas reached out to Lopez’ attorney, Robert Ramos, for comment. A person in Ramos’ office stated the attorney will not make a comment regarding his client.
“Agent Morales entered on duty with the U.S. Border Patrol February 18, 2008 as a member of border patrol academy class 749,” CBP officials wrote in a statement published by KVIA ABC7 in El Paso. “Please join the Border Patrol in offering condolences to the family, friends and co-workers of Agent Isaac Morales as they cope with this loss. We ask our community to keep Agent Morales’s loved ones in their thoughts and prayers during the difficult days ahead.”
CBS4 in El Paso captured police and Border Patrol officers and agents escorting the body of Agent Morales from the hospital.

Officials with the National Border Patrol Council Local 3307 Tweeted a statement of condolence following the loss of a fellow agent. “Our hears are heavy as we morun the loss of BP Agent Isaac Morales, may he rest in peace,” the Rio Grande Valley Sector union Tweeted.

After Melania Trump met with Pope Francis in the Vatican Wednesday, her spokeswoman confirmed that the First Lady is indeed a Roman Catholic, the first to occupy her post since Jackie Kennedy. The last time the United States had a Catholic as First Lady was during the presidency of John F. Kennedy, whose wife Jackie Kennedy—like him—was a Roman Catholic. When Melania moves into the White House together with their son Barron this summer, she will become the first Catholic occupant of the White House since the Kennedy era.
On meeting the Pope Wednesday, Melania asked him to bless her rosary and later visited the Bambin Gesù (Baby Jesus) pediatric hospital, where she met with young patients and their families, prayed in a chapel and laid flowers at the feet of a statue of the Virgin Mary.

Later that day, the First Lady’s spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham confirmed to DailMail.com that Melania is a practicing Catholic.
Having grown up in Slovenia, then part of the Communist and officially atheist Soviet bloc, it is unclear when Melania was baptized a Catholic. President Trump is a life-long Presbyterian, and he and Melania were married in a Palm Beach Florida Episcopal church.
Melania’s father was a nominal member of the Communist Party in order to be able to obtain employment.
In February, Melania kicked off a presidential rally in Melbourne, Florida, by reciting the Lord’s Prayer, beginning with the typical Catholic invocation “Let us pray.”
The first lady later tweeted about the development with the hashtags “#Blessings” and “#Faith.” In another tweet, she sent “blessings to all” after her audience with the pontiff, which she described as an “honor” she will never forget.
Today’s visit with His Holiness Pope Francis @Pontifex is one I’ll never forget. I was humbled by the honor. Blessings to all. pic.twitter.com/NiomkFQqJb 
— Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) May 24, 2017 

Mrs. Trump told Pope Francis at the Vatican that she was looking forward to going to the hospital “for the bambinos,” a visit she later described as “very moving.”
“To spend time speaking to and coloring with children who have such a positive spirit despite illness was an amazing gift,” she said.
“The time I spent with the little ones in the Intensive Care Unit is something I will never forget, and I will pray for each of them daily,” she said.

Merrill May,Texas Governor Signs Law to Crackdown on Teacher Sex Misconduct,"Texas Governor Signs Law to Crackdown on Teacher Sex Misconduct AP Photo/Stephen Spillman by Merrill Hope 25 May 2017 Austin, TX 0 25 May, 2017 25 May, 2017 SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill into law Thursday that crack downs on the vexing epidemic of sexual misconduct by the state’s teachers with students. 
“Unfortunately, a small number of teachers are tarnishing the image of some of our best and brightest teachers,” said Abbott at a signing ceremony in the State Capitol building flanked by several key legislators, notably Senator Paul Bettencourt (R-Houston), who authored this piece of legislation, Senate Bill 7 , and has called the eight-plus year upward surge in these improper teacher-student relationships a statewide plague . 
“Texas has racked up a dubious ranking, a ranking that has an incredibly high number of inappropriate teacher-student relationships,” added Abbott. “Today, by signing this law, we’re saying no more are we going to allow that to happen.” 
Abbott continued onto say that under S.B. 7 Texas is “going to impose real and stiff consequences for any teacher who dares to have an inappropriate relationship with one of his or her students.” 
The Governor expressed dismay that “unbelievably” some of these purported teacher sex offenders against whom accusations are made and cases even proven “have faced no real consequences.” 
This law mandates the automatic revocation of a teaching license when an educator receives deferred adjudication or must register as a sex offender for this abhorrent behavior. It may also result in jail time. S.B. 7 also holds principals and superintendents to account with fines and jail time when they look the other way and purposely fail to report teacher wanton misdeeds to the Texas Education Agency (TEA). Even an administrator’s unintentional failure to report sexual misconduct results in a $500 fine. 
S.B. 7 also criminalizes when an educator becomes romantically involved with a student under 18 years old, regardless of what school district the teacher works or where a student attends classes, which, until now, was not an offense. While the law does not not name a particular curriculum, it requires that teachers attend an ongoing percentage of professional development classes to ensure they maintain “appropriate relationships, boundaries, and communications between educators and students.” 
Abbott concluded: “I am proud to sign S.B. 7 to restore the trust that should exist between teachers and students, and also between parents and teachers to ensure that our schools remain a place where a child can go into that school with excitement to explore, to learn and to advance.” 
Breitbart Texas reported that, since 2008, the number of these cases opened by the Educator Investigations Unit of the Texas Education Agency (TEA) jumped 80 percent to an alarming all time high of 222 reported incidences in the 2015-16 school year. So startling the numbers, the TEA asked state lawmakers to fund nearly $400,000 in their 2018-19 academic budget for hiring two investigators and one administrator to better tackle the problem. The agency opened 159 new cases between September 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017; they estimated a 65 percent increase in these improper teacher-student sexual interludes statewide from April 2015 to April 2017. 
At the signing ceremony, Abbott thanked Bettencourt for his leadership. Also present were Education Commissioner Mike Morath; Representative Tony Dale (R-Round Rock), who authored companion House legislation plus two adopted S.B. 7 amendments; and Lt. Governor Dan Patrick, who named this issue one of his top 10 legislative priorities for the state’s 85th Legislature. During the interim session, Patrick charged Senate Education Committee members with developing policy solutions for this troubling problem. Representative Gary VanDeaver (R-New Boston) attended in the place of the bill’s House sponsor Ken King (R-Canadian). 
S.B. 7 has been among the few education related bills both chambers agreed upon, passing unanimously through the Senate and the House. 
Following the signing ceremony, Bettencourt commented, “It is very clear that the scourge of teachers preying on students for sexual relationships will not be tolerated.” 
He thanked Abbott for signing the bill and Patrick plus his fellow legislators for their full support. “It’s time for inappropriate teacher-student relationships to be stamped out.” 
This law goes into effect on September 1.

Donna Rachel May,Manchester Bomber Was Repeatedly Reported to Authorities Over Five Years,"Manchester Bomber Repeatedly Reported to Authorities over Five Year Period OLI SCARFF/AFP/Getty Images by Donna Rachel Edmunds 25 May 2017 0 25 May, 2017 25 May, 2017 SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER The police and security services missed at least five opportunities over five years to stop Salman Abedi from carrying out his deadly terror attack, it has emerged. 
Following the deadly attack at the Manchester Arena by Abedi on Tuesday night, which claimed 22 lives, questions are being raised as to why the British authorities did little to follow up on repeated reports from friends and community members that Abedi was radicalised and had expressed support for suicide bombing. 
The reports date back five years, when two youth workers are said to have phoned an anti-terrorism hotline to report concerns over Adebi’s “extreme views” whilst he was completing his last year at school, the BBC has reported. 
Two of Abedi’s friends were also so concerned about his behaviour that they separately phoned the hotline, five years ago, and again in 2016. 
“They had been worried that ‘he was supporting terrorism’ and had expressed the view that ‘being a suicide bomber was ok’,” a source told the BBC. 
Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, told The Telegraph that community members also reported Abedi to the authorities two years ago “because he thought he was involved in extremism and terrorism”. 
“People in the community expressed concerns about the way this man was behaving and reported it in the right way using the right channels,” Shafiq said. 
“They did not hear anything since.” 
Akram Ramadan, 49, a member of the south Manchester Libyan community where Abedi lived, said that Abedi had been banned from Didsbury Mosque after he confronted an imam who had delivered a sermon opposing extremism. 
Didsbury Mosque has confirmed that, following the incident, it contacted the Home Office’s Prevent anti-radicalisation programme to flag Abedi as a possible extremist. 
Mr. Ramadan said he believed that that report led to Abedi being placed on a watch list, yet he was allowed to travel to Libya and Syria repeatedly, before returning to Manchester to carry out his deadly plot. 
Last night Home Secretary Amber Rudd admitted that Abedi had been known to the British security services, whilst U.S. intelligence has confirmed he was also known to them. 
France’s interior minister has said Abedi had “proven” links with Islamic State, and that both French and British intelligence had information that he had been to Syria. 
But Frank Gardner, the BBC’s security correspondent, told Radio 4’s Today the opportunities were missed because the threat is so widespread. 
“This comes down to numbers,” Gardner said. “If they told us how many people had these extreme views just across the UK we wouldn’t sleep at night. It’s in the thousands. 
“They haven’t got the ‘watchers’ – they haven’t got the capability to follow all of those people, so they have to go where they think the danger is the most imminent and the most serious.” 
A security source told Sky News: “MI5 are working on 500 active investigations involving some 3,000 subjects of interest at any one time. Abedi was one of a larger pool of former subjects of interest whose risk remained subject to review by MI5 and its partners.” 
“Where former subjects of interest show known risks of re-engaging in terrorism, MI5 can consider reopening the investigation. This process relies on inevitable difficult judgements based on partial information,” the statement added. 
Eight arrests have now been made in connection to the plot, but police have admitted that with each arrest and new location discovered, the web of involvement widens. Just over 36 hours in, the investigation is already being described as “vast”. Read More Stories About:

Melania Trump smiles at passersby on a highway in Sevnica, Solvenia that reads “Welcome to the Hometown of First Lady” — a billboard that represents more than a celebration of its most famous citizen. The number of tourists in Slovenia rose by 8 percent year-on-year in March, with tourists booking overnight stays jumping a whopping 30.6 percent and tourists visiting by 22.5 percent, CNBC reported using data from the government’s statistics office.
“Analysts said domestic tourist figures reflected improved economic conditions in Slovenia, a country which narrowly avoided an international bailout for its banks in 2013 but expects economic growth of 3.6 percent this year versus 2.5 percent in 2016,” CNBC reported.
The unemployment rate also has improved — although no direct connection to the first lady is implicated — from 12 percent in March 2016 to 10.2 percent in March 2017.
In April the central European nation of Slovenia celebrated a milestone, CNN reported , at a time when one of its own will be living in the White House after First Son Barron Trump finishes the school year in New York.
Slovenian Ambassador to the United States Dr. Božo Cerar commemorated the 25th anniversary of U.S. recognition of the European nation by planting a Linden tree in the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C.
“Slovenians are ‘very proud’ that Trump is first lady, Cerar told CNN recently. “She has helped the nation’s visibility considerably, he said, noting that Americans no longer mix his country up with Slovakia, a ‘huge improvement.’”

Jeff May,Krauthammer on Trump Middle East Trip: 'America Is Back' - Breitbart,"by Jeff Poor 24 May 2017 0 24 May, 2017 24 May, 2017 SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER 
Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer spoke positively about President Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle East that began over the weekend. 
According to Krauthammer, Trump’s ability to unify Sunni nations against a hostile Iranian regime demonstrated that “America is back.” 
Watch: 
“I understand the theme, the three great religions, trying to tie them all together to make it look somewhat nonpolitical,” Krauthammer said. “But the real story is not the Vatican. It’s not even the Israeli trip. It is the realignment of American policy over Iran, getting the 50 Sunni nations lined up with Saudi Arabia, behind us. This is a new day in the Middle East, and it’s going to have reverberations for many years. That’s the story. It’s a new Middle East right now. America is back. That’s the story, and the consequences are going to be immense.

Lucas May,Report: How Silicon Valley Is Trying to Topple Trump - Breitbart,"Report: How Silicon Valley Is Trying to Topple Trump Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press by Lucas Nolan 25 May 2017 0 
25 May, 2017 25  
Recode has published a report outlining how Democrats are attempting to use contacts within the Tech world to further their political causes. Recode’s article titled “How Silicon Valley is trying to topple Trump — beginning with a special election in Montana” outlines how the team running the House of Representatives campaign for Democratic politician Rob Quist, “a guitar-toting first-timer in the hunt for Montana’s sole spot,” recruited Jessica Alter, a bay area resident who works to link digital tech companies with progressive candidates and causes.
Quist reportedly didn’t “ have a whole lot of help from the Democratic Party’s official organs ,” in his campaign and as a result was short staffed, particularly when it came to tech experts. This is where Alter steps in, running a group known as “Tech for Campaigns” with her partner Pete Kazanjy, Alter acts as a go-between for Democratic politicians in search of digital talent and engineers and designers in San Francisco and around the country.
Alter devised the idea for her company shortly after the election of President Trump, frustrated with his actions as president. “The first travel ban, the Muslim ban, put me over the edge, candidly because my father’s family was in the Holocaust, and my grandmother was very active in the Belgian underground,” Alter told Recode. “And I just imagined, what would she do?” Tech for Campaigns now has a network of nearly 3,000 volunteers comprised of data analytics and design experts from many high-ranking Silicon Valley companies such as Facebook, Netflix, Slack, and Salesforce.
Tech for Campaigns has so far aided state candidates in Virginia, a federal office-seeker in Kansas and now, Rob Quist in Montana. Tech for Campaigns helped Quist by directing his team in how to efficiently write, test, and target Facebook ads and helped the politician set up new methods of communicating with his organizers and voters via text message.
Discussing President Trump shortly before the Montana special election, Alter said “I think he was sort of a wake-up call. We do have this very large group of people who are interested in being involved, and the biggest travesty … is there just hasn’t been great resources for Democrats on the tech side that are available to a lot of people.”
Tech for Campaigns isn’t the only tech startup attempting to fight the Trump administration; Swing Left sought to raise money in crucial congressional districts in an attempt to take down major Republican players, while Resistbot attempted to make it easier for voters to alert their elected representatives of their own political views. Higher Ground Labs, run by former Obama administration digital aides, is an attempt to invest in cutting-edge tech startups.
“It definitely feels like a seminal moment, and I’ve been organizing people in the tech community for longer than just about anyone,” said Catherine Bracy, a tech expert who formerly worked on the Obama campaign, Code for America and the TechEquity Collaborative. Bracy recalled exiting a meeting along the Embarcadero one day earlier this year “and seeing a crowd of Google employees chanting and waving protest signs. And I knew then this was something different.”

A Civil War battlefield museum in Georgia is closing its doors after a local politician demanded that the establishment discontinues its use of the Confederate flag. After Commissioner Dee Clemmons of Hampton, Georgia, demanded that the Nash Farm Battlefield Museum tear down the flags in its Confederate displays that explain the battle to visitors, the museum decided to close its doors, saying it could not properly explain history if half of its displays were to be censored, WFMY reported .
Tim Knight, who represents the nonprofit group that runs the museum, said Clemmons spoke with the color of authority of the county and felt that he was given no choice but to close the museum.
“Nash Farms has always represented both sides of the conflict,” Stuart Carter, a supporter of the museum, said of the five-year-old establishment.
“Sure I understand some people find the imaging of (the Confederacy) offensive,” Carter added. “But if we try and erase it from history, then we can’t remember how we messed up and why we shouldn’t go back there again.”
The group running the museum insisted that it could not properly relay the history of the 1864 battle without its Confederate artifacts and displays.
But a county spokesperson said it was “reasonable” to demand that the Confederate flag displays be censored.
“I think it’s reasonable. I think there were plenty of artifacts in the museum that can tell the story of the Civil War. And I think it was a reasonable request,” county spokeswoman Melissa Robinson said.
The controversy comes amid similar discussions in states across the south, as Charlottesville, Virginia , and New Orleans, Louisiana , debate removing Confederate symbols and memorials.

Dr. Susan May,Video: Abortion Providers Share Graphic Details of Dismembering Unborn Children - Breitbart,"Video: Abortion Providers Share Graphic Details of Dismembering Unborn Children Center for Medical Progress Preview (Screenshot / YouTube) by Dr. Susan Berry 25 May 2017 0

Newly released footage of the 2014 and 2015 National Abortion Federation trade shows reveal abortionists discussing the difficulties they face in their jobs, such as “the head that gets stuck that we can’t get out,” and “an eyeball just fell down into my lap, and that is gross!” 
The video, published to YouTube on Wednesday, is the work of Center for Medical Progress leader David Daleiden who, along with co-defendant Sandra Merritt, has been charged with 15 felony counts under California’s law protecting “confidential” conversations.
Daleiden’s criminal defense attorneys say the California Attorney General’s interest in his case is “entirely political, meant to manipulate the law to do the bidding of their benefactors at Planned Parenthood.”
Former Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley & Associates (SCA) are defending Daleiden, the journalist who released the series of videos in 2015 that shocked the nation as they brought attention to the fetal tissue procurement industry.
The undercover investigation led to congressional probes into allegations that Planned Parenthood sells the body parts of babies aborted in its clinics for a profit, and to vehement cries for the elimination of Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding.
Cooley and former Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Brentford J. Ferreira are launching a new media resource page that features all the filings in the case against Daleiden and all the videos mentioned by the California AG in their complaint, including those that have never been seen before.
In the new video, which is a compilation of excerpts from video filmed at the trade shows, abortionist Dr. Susan Robinson of Planned Parenthood Mar Monte is heard saying, “The fetus is a tough little object and, taking it apart, I mean taking it apart on day one is very difficult.”
Dr. Lisa Harris, medical director of Planned Parenthood Michigan, is also heard saying, “Let’s just give them all the violence, it’s a person, it’s killing, let’s just give them all that.”
Director of abortion services for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast Dr. Ann Schutt-Aine states in the video, “If I’m doing a procedure, and I’m seeing that I’m in fear that it’s about to come to the umbilicus [navel], I might ask for a second set of forceps to hold the body at the cervix and pull off a leg or two, so it’s not PBA [partial-birth abortion].”
SCA states the prosecution from the California AG against Daleiden is “grossly politically-motivated.”
In April of 2016, Daleiden contacted SCA immediately after agents of the AG’s office served a search warrant at his home and confiscated his computers, hard drives, and electronic documents.
“Then-Attorney General, now U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, wielded unprecedented police power against a true American journalist while civil suits were already pending in Federal District Court concerning the same video-recordings,” says Cooley. “Public Records Act requests filed by SCA reveal the Attorney General’s real interest in this case is entirely political, meant to manipulate the law to do the bidding of their benefactors at Planned Parenthood.”
In September 2016, emails obtained by the Washington Times showed that then-California AG and U.S. Senate candidate Kamala Harris’s office collaborated with Planned Parenthood to produce legislation that specifically targeted Daleiden.
The emails, according to the Times , were accessed through a public records request, and revealed conversations between officials of Kamala’s office and Planned Parenthood regarding legislation that criminalizes undercover journalists for publishing and distributing recordings of private communications with abortion providers.
Following receipt of a preliminary injunction in a civil suit – currently on appeal – against the release of Daleiden’s videos from secretive abortion trade shows, the National Abortion Federation (NAF) and Planned Parenthood pursued the California AG to initiate a criminal investigation in order to stifle Daleiden’s undercover work even further.
On March 28, 2017, the new California Attorney General, Xavier Becerra, announced a criminal complaint charging Daleiden and Merritt with 15 felony counts against the state’s “confidentiality” legislation.
“Every video recording for which the Attorney General is charging David was obviously and unquestionably made in a public place where it could not possibly be considered ‘confidential,’” says Brent Ferreira. “The only difference between David’s conduct and that of undercover video journalists every day in the state of California is the fact that he recorded the political backers of the state’s top prosecutor.”
SCA points out that Daleiden’s accusers were listed in the complaint anonymously as Does 1 through 14. The attorneys’ request for the names of the Does was ignored, and the Attorney General later informed them their names were confidential.
“There is no protective order in place in state court that would protect the names of the Does, and David is entitled to a public defense,” SCA states.
“The First Amendment must apply equally whether you are pro-choice or pro-life,” says Ferreira, “and a publicly-accused defendant is entitled to face his accusers in a public trial. Anything less is a corrupt attempt by the Attorney General to orchestrate a star-chamber proceeding reminiscent of the witch hunts and show trials of more unenlightened eras.”

Ben May,Republican Senators Urge Trump to Exit Paris Climate Deal,"Republican Senators Urge Trump to Exit Paris Climate Deal AP/Mosa'ab Elshamy by Ben Kew 25 May 2017 0

Twenty-two Republican senators have sent a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to exit the Paris Climate Agreement signed by Barack Obama last November. The letter, which is signed by the likes of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, urges Trump to make a “clean break” from the agreement. An excerpt, published on Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe’s website, reads:
Because of existing provisions within the Clean Air Act and others embedded in the Paris Agreement, remaining in it would subject the United States to significant litigation risk that could upend your Administration’s ability to fulfill its goal of rescinding the Clean Power Plan. Accordingly, we strongly encourage you to make a clean break from the Paris Agreement.
During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump was a prominent critic of the deal, promising to “cancel” it, and this week he refused to sign a statement endorsing the agreement. Although Trump could not instantly pull America out, he could initiate the process for the country’s exit.
However, Trump has recently toned down his rhetoric and delayed a decision on the agreement, amid reports that the administration is divided over the issue .
Some of Trump’s closest advisers including Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson believe that the United States should remain in the Paris accord, while EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, chief strategist Steve Bannon and Energy Secretary Rick Perry have called to exit.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer previously confirmed that Trump would make a decision on the agreement following a meeting with international industrial leaders at the G7 summit this weekend.
Other world leaders will lobby Trump to stay in the Paris climate agreement at the G-7 meeting, given that all other G-7 members – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the European Union – support the agreement.
Since taking office, Trump has revoked a range of environmental legislation—including Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan regulations – with a plan to focus on energy independence and revitalize the coal industry. In his first White House budget, Trump proposed a 31 percent cut to the EPA’s overall budget.

Joel B. May,The Media Try Blaming Donald Trump for Gianforte in Montana - Breitbart,"The Media Try Blaming Donald Trump for Gianforte in Montana Bob Etheridge assault (Screenshot / YouTube) by Joel B. Pollak  
Republican Greg Gianforte alleged assault on UK Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs on Wednesday would appear to be utterly indefensible. There is little room for doubt about what happened in Montana: there were multiple eyewitnesses, and Gianforte was charged with assault that day. If Gianforte loses Thursday’s special election in Montana, he will deserve to lose it.
At the same time, nothing justifies the mainstream media’s effort to blame President Donald Trump for what happened. And the media’s hypocrisy is evident in their failure to blame President Barack Obama when Democrats used violence in similar cases.
The most relevant example is the case of former Rep. Bob Etheridge (D-NC), who assaulted a student (see photo above) who was filming him on a public street in 2010 and asking him if he “fully support[ed] the Obama agenda.”
The incident was captured on film, and the story was broken by Breitbart News. Etheridge went on to lose his congressional race to Republican Renée Elmers (who was unseated last year).
There was also a similar (though less severe) report in Montana itself in 2012, when a local Democrat was accused of slapping the phone out of the hands of a reporter asking questions.
Today, Trump’s critics are citing President Trump’s claim that the media are the “enemy of the people,” among other statements, to claim that he has implicitly condoned Gianforte allegedly did.
But when Andrew Breitbart pointed out that Obama’s deputy chief of staff, Jim Messina, had told Democrats in 2009 to “punch back twice as hard,” and connected that incendiary rhetoric to the beating of black vendor Kenneth Gladney by leftist thugs outside a Missouri town hall, the media were silent.
They never tried blaming President Obama for Etheridge or any of the other incidents.
It is not “whataboutism” to compare these cases, because all can — or should — agree that candidates physically attacking journalists is indefensible. But the media can and must be expected to apply a uniform standard to politicians from both parties.
Instead, today, the media are showing their true partisan colors by using the Gianforte incident to impugn Trump — when they never did the same to Obama.
The most ridiculous example was on CNN Wednesday night, when host Don Lemon badgered guest Paris Dennard, insisting that he blame Trump, snorting when he would not, and then attacking Dennard’s bona fides: “I can’t believe that you believe the words that are coming out of your mouth.” He cut Dennard off when he tried to reply.
The double standard reveals that Trump’s critics are not concerned — at least, not primarily — about press freedom.
Arguably, their effort to blame Trump for what happened in Montana, when they gave Barack “ we bring a gun ” Obama a perpetual pass, undermines efforts to convince the public to take attacks on journalists more seriously.

Neil May,Federal Judges Invite Muslims To Veto Americans' Elections Over Campaign Statements - Breitbart,"by Neil Munro 25 May 2017 0 25 May, 2017 25 May, 2017 SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Ten progressive judges in Virginia have decided that Muslims can ask judges to change the nation’s national security and immigration policies whenever prior campaign statements in democratic political elections can be described as unfair to Muslims living in America. 
“To the extent that our review chills campaign promises to condemn and exclude entire religious groups, we think that a welcome restraint,” boasted the majority opinion, which was approved by 10 judges on the Richmond-based Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and announced May 25. President Donald Trump’s Executive Order on Islamic migration “ speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination” from the 2016 election campaign, the judges insisted. 
However, a dissent approved by three judges highlighted the political ambitions and risks hiding behind the court’s declaration of support for the Islamic plaintiffs. “The danger of the majority’s new rule is that it will enable any court to justify its decision to strike down any executive action with which it disagrees,” says three three-judge dissent, which concluded: 
Unless corrected by the Supreme Court, the majority’s new approach, which is unsupported by any Supreme Court case, will become a sword for plaintiffs to challenge facially neutral government actions, particularly those affecting regions dominated by a single religion. Government officials will avoid speaking about religion, even privately, lest a court discover statements that could be used to ascribe a religious motivation to their future actions. And, in the more immediate future, our courts will be faced with the unworkable task of determining when this President’s supposed religious motive [in the 2016 election] has sufficiently dissipated so as to allow executive action toward these or other majority Muslim countries. 
The lawsuit by was brought by Muslim plaintiffs, backed up by a huge array of establishment progressive corporate lawyers, against President Trump’s Executive Order, which merely temporarily blocked or curbed Muslim immigration from six of 50-Muslim-majority countries around the world. 
The temporary block is intended to help officials institute new safeguards against Islamic-inspired attacks by the growing inflow of Muslim immigrants, refugees, and their future American-born children, into an increasingly diverse, chaotic and divided nation. 
The judges’ deference to the Muslim plaintiffs comes after 16 years of deadly, repeated and destructive attacks on Americans motivated by the Islamic religion, starting on 9/11, 2001. Since then, U.S. forces have gone to war in several majority-Muslim countries to curb terrorism, and more than 101 people named after Islam’s primary warrior/prophet have been arrested and convicted by domestic courts for various jihad and terror-related offenses. 
That bloody and violent record was important to voters in the 2016 election, where the subsequently elected president, Donald Trump, gained support by promising to reduce immigration of Muslims and to step up vetting of would-be Muslim immigrants. Trump’s position was bolstered in June 2016 when the son of Muslim immigrants murdered 49 Americans at the Pulse nightclub in Florida. 
However, progressive Democrats, establishment Republicans, and business leaders strongly favor a continued inflow of cheap workers, extra consumers and likely future Democratic voters, regardless of the economic and security impact on Americans. 
In the dissent authored by Circuit Judge Paul Niemeyer, the three moderate judges scoffed at the 10 judges for ignoring prior Supreme Court guidance. The logic of the 10 judges’ decision, says the dissent, is that any future court: 
need only find one [campaign] statement that contradicts the stated reasons for a subsequent executive action and thereby pronounce that reasons for the executive action are a pretext … 
Moreover, the unbounded nature of the majority’s new rule will leave the President and his Administration in a clearly untenable position for future action. It is undeniable that President Trump will need to engage in foreign policy regarding majority-Muslim nations, including those designated by the Order. And yet the majority now suggests that at least some of those future actions might also be subject to the same challenges upheld today. Presumably, the majority does not intend entirely to stop the President from creating policies that address these nations, but it gives the President no guidelines for “cleansing” himself of the “taint” they have purportedly identified… 
Finally, the new rule would by itself chill political speech directed at voters seeking to make their election decision. It is hard to imagine a greater or more direct chill on campaign speech than the knowledge that any statement made may be used later to support the inference of some nefarious intent when official actions are inevitably subjected to legal challenges. Indeed, the majority does not even deny that it employs an approach that will limit communication to voters. Instead, it simply opines remarkable that such chilling is “a welcome restraint.” 
The Supreme Court surely will shudder at the majority’s adoption of this new rule that has no limits or bounds — one that transforms the [10-judge] majority’s criticisms of a candidate’s various campaign statements into a constitutional violation… 
It engages in its own review of the national security justifications supporting the Order and concludes that protecting national security could not be the President’s “primary purpose.” As evidence, the majority points to the President’s level of consultation with national security agencies before issuing the Order; the content of internal Department of Homeland Security reports; the comments of former national security officials made in an amicus brief; and its own assessment of the national security threats described in the Order … The majority’s intense factual inquiry is particularly inappropriate where the government’s secular purpose is related to national security — a subject, as the majority recognizes, on which we owe the executive significant deference… 
Unless corrected by the Supreme Court, the majority’s new approach, which is unsupported by any Supreme Court case, will become a sword for plaintiffs to challenge facially neutral government actions, particularly those affecting regions dominated by a single religion. Government officials will avoid speaking about religion, even privately, lest a court discover statements that could be used to ascribe a religious motivation to their future actions. And, in the more immediate future, our courts will be faced with the unworkable task of determining when this President’s supposed religious motive has sufficiently dissipated so as to allow executive action toward these or other majority Muslim countries. The Establishment Clause demands none of these unfortunate and unprecedented results.

Ian May,"Travel Ban Blocked Again, Possible Supreme Court Showdown - Breitbart","Travel Ban Blocked Again, Possible Supreme Court Showdown AP by Ian Mason 25 May 2017 Richmond, VA 0

An en banc panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld an injunction against President Donald Trump’s executive order curtailing travel and immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries Thursday. The 10-3 majority, in a 67-page opinion , affirmed the decision of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, in essence holding that even an executive order that makes no mention of Islam in its text can be invalidated for violating the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause because of comments Trump and his associates made during and after the 2016 presidential election.
Calling the Establishment Clause a “untiring sentinel for the protection of one of our most cherished founding principles,” Chief Judge Roger Gregory’s opinion for the court calls the travel ban “an Executive Order that in text speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.”
“Congress granted the President broad power to deny entry to aliens, but that power is not absolute,” Gregory writes, discounting that the wide latitude given to the President under the Immigration and Nationality Act to deny entry to classes of travelers and immigrants on national security grounds justifies President Trump’s executive order.
The majority then launches into a litany of quotes from President Trump, his advisers, and his campaign website made during and after the election season of 2016, as proof that the travel ban represents a government “purpose” to favor one religion over another. Relying on Establishment Clause precedent that has never been applied in the immigration context, the court decided that the administration’s proffered purpose of keeping Americans safe from terrorism was a mere pretext for disfavoring the Islamic faith.
One quote used to establish an unacceptable purpose was that of then-Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Peirson on CNN that, “I think Islam hates us … [W]e can’t allow people coming into the country who have this hatred … [w]e’ve allowed this propaganda to spread all through the country that [Islam] is a religion of peace.”
The court dismisses the national security rationale for the order, conducting its own inquiry into the efficacy of the travel ban in protecting Americans. The majority cites “former National Security Officials” saying the order serves “no legitimate national security purpose” and that “there is no evidence of any new security risks emanating from these countries.”
The majority also gave credence to the claims of some of the Muslim plaintiffs, represented by a litany of progressive legal groups led by the American Civil Liberties Union, that the existence of the travel ban causes them irreparable damages by causing “them feelings of disparagement and exclusion” or feeling “isolated and disparaged in [their] community.” They cite one plaintiff who claimed that his wife, who wears the hijab in public “sense[s] a lot of hostility from people” and that his hijab-wearing neices “say that people make mean comments and stare at them for being Muslim.”
Each of the three dissenting Judges filed separate dissenting opinions and joined in each others’. Judge Paul Niemeyer, relying on precedent that holds that the foreign affairs context in which the executive order operates is the apex of executive power, chatised the majority for its refusal to limit its inquiry to the text of the order itself:
In looking behind the face of the government’s action for facts to show the alleged bad faith, rather than looking for bad faith on the face of the executive action itself, the majority grants itself the power to conduct an extratextual search for evidence suggesting bad faith, which is exactly what three Supreme Court opinions have prohibited.
Thursday’s ruling represents a ruling on the merits of the case and cements the injunction preventing the order from coming into effect. The only avenue remaining for the administration to continue its defense of the order is a petition for a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States. This would set up a final showdown over the constitutionality of the travel ban before the nation’s highest court.
As the travel ban was always a temporary measure only to apply for 90 days, a term set to expire in June, the government will likely have to petition the Supreme Court on an emergency basis in order to have the Court reconvene to hear arguments before the case becomes moot.

Facebook moderators have been ordered to remove “dehumanizing” posts about migrants and refugees, but not Holocaust denial posts in countries where it’s outlawed, according to a new report . “The files explain that moderators should take down Holocaust denial material in only four of the 14 countries where it is outlawed,” reported The Guardian on Wednesday, referencing leaked Facebook training documents. “One document says the company ‘does not welcome local law that stands as an obstacle to an open and connected world’ and will only consider blocking or hiding Holocaust denial messages and photographs if ‘we face the risk of getting blocked in a country or a legal risk.'”
Though Facebook stated in the documents that refugees and migrants also “will not receive the protections given to other vulnerable groups,” the social network has allegedly told moderators “to remove dehumanising speech or any ‘calls for violence’ against refugees.”
“Content ‘that says migrants should face a firing squad or compares them to animals, criminals or filth’ also violate its guidelines,” explained The Guardian in their report . “According to the documents, comments permitted under the policy include ones such as: ‘Islam is a religion of hate. Close the borders to immigrating Muslims until we figure out what the hell is going on’; ‘migrants are so filthy’; ‘migrants are thieves and robbers’; and ‘Mexican immigrants are freeloaders mooching off of tax dollars we don’t even have.'”
“Fuck immigrant” and “Keep the horny migrant teenagers away from our daughters,” are also allegedly allowed on the platform, however “it is a violation of the rules on migrants to ‘equate them to other types of criminals, eg rapists, child molesters, murderers or terrorists.'”
“As a quasi-protected category, they will not have the full protections of our hate speech policy because we want to allow people to have broad discussions on migrants and immigration which is a hot topic in upcoming elections,” stated Facebook in their training manual. “Countries are not protected… people from a country are protected”.
Followers of particular religions are also protected, as well as sexual orientations (including “asexuals”), while political ideologies, politicians, and physical traits are all allowed.
Austria, France, Germany, and Israel are the only countries listed in the documents where moderators should remove Holocaust denial posts, “not on grounds of taste, but because the company fears it might get sued.”

President Donald Trump criticized American government officials for leaking sensitive classified information, promising to prosecute the leakers to the “fullest extent of the law.” “The alleged leaks coming out of government agencies are deeply troubling,” Trump said in a statement. “The leaks of sensitive information pose a grave threat to our national security.”
Trump’s statement was released in reaction to the news that British police officers would no longer share information related to the Manchester bombing suspects after it was leaked to the American media. In response, British Prime Minister Theresa May stated she would address their concerns during a meeting with Trump on Thursday.
“I will make clear to President Trump that intelligence shared between our security agencies must remain secure,” she said .
Trump said he would ask the Department of Justice to review the recent leaks and prosecute them.
“I am asking the Department of Justice and other relevant agencies to launch a complete review of this matter, and if appropriate, the culprit should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” he said.
Trump also specifically signaled support for the relationship between Britain and the United States.
“There is no relationship we cherish more than the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom,” he said.

Adam Shaw,Montana House Race Heats Up as Bodies Fly and Democrats Smell Blood,"by Adam Shaw 25 May 2017 0 25 May, 2017 25 May, 2017 SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Montana isn’t known for exciting political races, but a race for an open House seat in the Treasure State has turned into a cocktail of “House of Cards” and WWE, with Democrats smelling an upset in the traditionally red state as the Republican candidate was charged after allegedly body-slamming a reporter. 
Republican Greg Gianforte (pictured), a millionaire and tech entrepreneur, and Democrat Rob Quist are vying to take the seat left vacant by Ryan Zinke after Zinke became President Trump’s Interior Secretary. 
Voters go to the polls Thursday night in a race being watched closely by politicos across the nation trying to get a sense of how Trump’s turbulent time in the White House may affect the midterms next year. 
Trump won Montana by over 20 points in 2016, and while Gianforte was expected to win easily, polls have the lead tightening as Democrats look to make the race a referendum on Trump’s recent controversies in Washington and the GOP health care bill. A Democratic poll conducted last month showed Gianforte’s lead was just six points. 
“We are literally in a dogfight right now,” a Montana Republican familiar with the race told The Hill. “I think it is essentially a toss-up. It’s really tightening up. The nationalization of the race contributed to a lot of that.” 
But the race was (literally) thrown into turmoil late Wednesday when Ben Jacobs, a reporter for the Guardian , alleged he was “body-slammed” by Gianforte when asking about the CBO score on the Republican health care bill. 
Gianforte’s campaign pushed back, saying that Jacobs entered the office without permission and “aggressively shoved” a recorder in the candidate’s face. The statement says Jacobs was asked to leave and to lower the recorder (neither of which is heard on a recording released by the Guardian ). 
“Greg then attempted to grab the phone that was pushed in his face. Jacobs grabbed Greg’s wrist, and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground,” the statement said . 
Fox News’ Alicia Acuna also supported Jacob’s account saying Gianforte grabbed Jacobs “b y the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground behind him.” 
Gianforte has been charged with misdemeanor assault and appeared to go dark Thursday, canceling interviews with both Fox News and NBC’s Meet the Press. Update: @GregForMontana 's campaign has cancelled his appearance on @MSNBC 's #MTPDaily this evening. https://t.co/vOZE8uURa9 
— Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) May 25, 2017 
At least three newspapers, the Helena Independent Record , the Missoulian and the Billings Gazette , pulled their endorsements of Gianforte in the wake of the incident. Meanwhile, Democrats seized on the alleged assault, with both MoveOn.org and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee launching ads that played audio of the incident. Here’s the ad we launched last night targeting Montana VOTERS. There’s still time to stop Greg Gianforte after his alleged violent assault. pic.twitter.com/pYp8E7Bebb 
— DCCC (@dccc) May 25, 2017 
How much the “body-slam” will affect the race is debatable. Absentee ballots have already been cast before the incident, and are likely to be considerable as any voter can vote by absentee ballot, while voters voting on the issues that affect them are unlikely to be dissuaded by a fight with a beltway reporter. 
Similar “fatal” controversies in the presidential campaign only boosted Trump– who Gianforte has drawn close to. However, others may see it as a sign of the candidate’s instability, and it could turn undecided voters who aren’t engaged off Gianforte. It is also almost certainly going to be the only thing voters hear about before going to the polls. 
A key factor in the race will also be how motivated the Democratic base is, which will also be a deciding factor in the 2018 midterms. Democrats are hopeful that Trump will motivate their base to turn out in the same way President Barack Obama motivated the Republican base to turn out in 2010. 
But while some were looking for a big Democratic turnout to serve up a big upset in Montana, others were lowering expectations. 
Matt McKenna, a Democratic strategist working with Quist, told Politico that while enthusiasm appears to be high, “the same people who tell you they know what turnout is going to be are the people who try to get you to buy a time share in Panama City, Florida.”

President Donald Trump urged members of the NATO alliance to start paying their fair share Thursday in Brussels, pointing out that their failures were hurting American taxpayers. “NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations,” Trump said, pointing out that 23 of 28 members were still not paying enough money for their national defense and even owed a great deal of money.
“This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States,” Trump said, reminding the foreign leaders that the United States spent more on defense than all the other nations together.
The president made his remarks during the unveiling of a memorial which featured the Berlin Wall and a section of one of the Twin Towers that were destroyed by terrorists on 9/11.
Trump admitted that his call was “very, very direct,” but essential for keeping the alliance together.
“We have to make up for the many years lost,” Trump said. “Two percent is the bare minimum for confronting today’s very real and very vicious threats.”
He also alluded to the cost of the new NATO headquarters building, suggesting that it was another expense shouldered by the American taxpayer.
“I never asked once what the new NATO headquarters cost, I refuse to do that, but it is beautiful,” he said.

John Binder,PHOTOS: First Lady Melania Trump Radiates In High Fashion During Trip Abroad,"PHOTOS: First Lady Melania Trump Radiates In High Fashion During Trip Abroad EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP/Getty Images by John Binder 25 May 2017 0 25 May, 2017 25 May, 2017 SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER First Lady Melania Trump became the breakout star of President Donald Trump’s first trip abroad, stunning fashion industry observers by wearing only the highest quality in high fashion. 
From visits to Saudi Arabia to Israel to Brussels, the former model First Lady set her sights on an extensive wardrobe made only for the most discerning of fashion tastes. In Reem Acra, to Ralph Lauren, to her love for custom-made Dolce & Gabbana, Melania Trump took the world by storm with her style, channeling an elegance and grace that perhaps hasn’t been seen since former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. 
Saudi Arabia 
As Melania departed with her husband for the administration’s first foreign trip, the First Lady stunned in a Max Mara creme-toned knit sweater and Hervé Pierre rust-colored leather skirt. American Vogue deemed the look Melania’s “most fashion-forward ensemble since she became First Lady.” JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images 
When Melania arrived in Saudi Arabia, she opted for a flowing black jumpsuit by Stella McCartney coupled with a striking, over-sized gold Saint Laurent belt made of python to cinch her thin frame. The belt could be viewed as a nod to the Trump family’s famous sky-high, opulent gold apartment in Trump Tower in New York City. MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images 
During the trip, Melania changed into a safari-inspired Ralph Lauren Collection button-down dress, paired with gold bangles and zebra-printed Manolo Blahnik heels as she visited the American International School in the country. GIUSEPPE CACACE/AFP/Getty Images GIUSEPPE CACACE/AFP/Getty Images 
At night, while in Saudi Arabia, Melania stuck to the fashion houses she wears the most. During one occasion, the First Lady donned a vibrant purple Reem Acra gown with a flowing cape to match her famous tousled locks. 
On her last night in the Islamic country, Melania was the image of grace and power during her husband’s speech to Saudi leaders as she wore a white Dolce & Gabbana paint-suit paired with a ruffled black blouse and Manolo Blahnik black pumps made of snakeskin. MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images 
Israel 
After departing Saudi Arabia, Melania stepped off Air Force One in Israel in an all-American Michael Kors strong-shouldered skirt-suit, cinched with a matching white belt and over-sized black sunglasses. Melania paired the monochromatic look with a red and white version of the Manolo Blahnik zebra-printed heels she wore in Saudi Arabia, which matched her husband’s tie. The Israeli press hailed Melania as “a statuesque former model with impeccable taste and a figure on which even a potato sack would look sophisticated.” GALI TIBBON/AFP/Getty Images 
For her dinner look in Israel, Melania went back to her roots with a sultry, somewhat transparent black-laced slip Dolce & Gabbana that covered most of her long legs. MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images 
At the Holocaust memorial, Melania wore a white and creme-striped sleeveless dress by designer Roksanda, whom the First Lady famously wore for the Republican National Convention. To top the look off, Melania wore nude-toned Manolo Blahnik heels and no jewelry, besides her wedding ring. Melania remained in the ensemble as she departed Israel, adding only her dark shades.

Rome, Italy 
For her trip to Rome, Italy, Melania gave a nod to one of her favorite Italian fashion houses, Dolce & Gabbana, as she wore a custom-made black coat-dress with gold brocade details on the collar and sleeves. The First Lady is friends with Stefabo Gabbana, who has previously praised Melania for her elegant style. MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images FILIPPO MONTEFORTE/AFP/Getty Images 
In a visit to meet Pope Francis, Melania worked with Dolce & Gabbana, again, on a stunning custom-made, black coat-dress that showed off a beautiful round collar, framing the First Lady’s face. The look was paired with a black lace Mantilla and black Manolo Blahnik stilettos, sticking to the Vatican dress code. In an Instagram post, Gabbana thanked Melania for wearing his creation. 
For departing Italy, Melania looked like a true Italian-inspired jet-setter, as she boarded Air Force One with over-sized square black sunglasses, a Dolce & Gabbana black lace dress, matching black Manolo Blahnik heels along with a black purse with silver clasps, a rarity for the First Lady.

Brussels, Belgium 
Sticking with the coat and belt-themed looks for the trip, Melania walked out of Air Force One in Brussels, Belgium in a blue and white gingham belted coat from the Michael Kors Collection and matching dress underneath. The First Lady wore gingham Manolo Blahnik heels which also matched the look.
