This guy brought a baseball bat to a knife fight ― and won. 
Watch blade-brandishing assailants attempt to rob a convenience store in Rotterdam, New York, on Monday, only to meet up with owner Gurchran Singh and his bat. 
Singh said he bopped one of the suspects, and his wife followed with a rod of some sort to help chase both crooks out of the store. 
“ No mess with Singh , you know?!” the owner told News 10. 
You got that right. 
According to WGRB, Singh then jumped in a truck with a neighbor and tracked the men, helping police find and arrest them.

David Wood,These Military Vets Have Found A Smarter Way To Fight The War On Terror,"05/25/2017 01:18 pm ET | Updated 1 day ago These Military Vets Have Found A Smarter Way To Fight The War On Terror “We just can’t keep killing our way out of this problem.” By David Wood 
During four hard combat tours as a Marine commander, Jake Harriman began to understand why the United States is failing to eradicate violent Islamic extremism. 
Individual heroics and immense sacrifice over 16 years have enabled American combat troops and special forces to win their battles with the Taliban, al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Those extremist militias are virtually powerless against U.S. drones and airstrikes, which have killed dozens of senior leaders. But still, jihadist movements persist and grow. 
Afghan kids keep joining the Taliban, which controls a growing swath of Afghanistan. ISIS, despite battlefield setbacks, recruits passionate believers in Syria, Afghanistan and Libya, not to mention Manchester, England, and Minneapolis . Extremist militias across Africa, around the Middle East and in Southeast Asia draw volunteers. And terrorism continues. 
What Jake Harriman and his fellow Marines saw was that the United States, for all its battlefield prowess, does not recognize or act on the causes of violence. 
But the extremists do. 
“We were going out every night on these snatch-and-grab missions and we began to see we were taking three steps forward, two steps back. The guys we were fighting were out in these villages winning hearts and minds,” Harriman, 42, told HuffPost. “They were dropping off food, they were building schools, they were building clinics. And yes, they were horribly oppressive. But these vulnerable populations were so impoverished that the parents had no other choices to feed their kids.” Courtesy of Nuru International Jake Harriman began developing his ideas on what defeats extremists and what doesn't during four combat tours in Iraq and southwest Asia. 
Standing in dusty battle gear in the desolate Iraqi landscape a decade ago, Harriman was struck by this epiphany: Military force alone isn’t going to obliterate extremist violence. In his words, “We just can’t keep killing our way out of this problem.” 
Convinced he could do better, Harriman resigned his Marine commission, earned a graduate business degree at Stanford University, formed a company and moved to southwest Kenya. He went into the rural villages where he thought deep poverty might not cause violent extremism, but was likely providing fertile ground for the militias. There, he found impoverished farmers so desperate that they would support or even join al-Shabab, the Somalia-based extremist militia, for whatever help it might offer. The guys we were fighting were out in these villages winning hearts and minds. Jake Harriman, a former Marine commander in Iraq 
What’s different about Harriman’s approach from that of traditional aid efforts is that he combines the gritty realism of the warfighter with the data-driven analytics of the business entrepreneur. 
Over seven years, Harriman and his Kenyan co-workers have helped organize locally owned and operated cooperatives that enable families to rise above subsistence farming, by marketing their excess crops and saving money in a communal banking system from which they can draw loans to expand their farms. His organization, Nuru International , has aided 85,000 people, he said, and blunted the appeal of the jihadis. 
“We began to have an impact in these gangs’ ability to recruit, by giving options to the young men” in the villages, Harriman said. “Now they could actually feed their families. They could actually have farming as a business. They now had a future … that diminished the gangs’ abilities to recruit in these rural areas.” 
Jake Harriman is one of a number of Americans who worked in the Iraq and Afghanistan war zones and came away convinced that the United States needs a better plan of engagement for places vulnerable to extremist recruiting. America, they argue, needs to rely less on military power and more on “smart power.” Lasting change, they say, depends on intimate knowledge of the local population, understanding why people there turn to violence, and designing narrowly focused interventions to help. 
Now if they can just get the funding to carry on. STEFAN HEUNIS/AFP/Getty Images Extreme poverty and malnutrition in parts of Nigeria enable extremist militias such as Boko Haram to attract recruits and support. 
Unlike traditional global development programs, the new reformers are using microdata to document the precise local causes of instability and to measure the impact of the resources invested in specific areas. 
In the southern Philippines, former Green Beret Justin Richmond found a farming community where impoverished kids were joining the ISIS affiliate for money. He helped set up a village co-op and invest in a solar dryer for harvested rice and corn. Five tons of produce were saved from rotting and sold, and the profits were re-invested. The next time terrorist recruiters showed up, he said, the townspeople told them to get lost and called in the military. 
In Libya, Development Transformations , which has several former members of the U.S. military among its leadership team, monitors the social media of extremist militias. With the aid of data processing and analysis firms ZignalLabs and DEV Results , the Washington, D.C.-based group designs counter-messaging initiatives and tracks any resulting change in local attitudes. 
“You don’t just want to know that the enemy is there, but why he is there,” said M. Shands Pickett, a company director who spent three years in Afghanistan as part of U.S. military intelligence and counterterrorism operations. “If you shoot him in the face, there are more coming, and there is an infinite supply of enemy and a finite supply of us,” he told HuffPost. 
“But if you can begin to answer why the enemy is there and understand the sources of instability in that particular place, then you don’t have to shoot so many of them in the face,” said Pickett. 
This generation of war-hardened activists sees their work not necessarily as a replacement for military intervention, but as a critical element of the larger U.S. strategy. Their ideas are not entirely new, but they’ve struggled to gain the ear of the national security establishment. 
Some people listened. In 2008, for instance, State Department experts and special forces soldiers were teaching counterinsurgency techniques at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to troops bound for Iraq and Afghanistan. Thomas Baltazar, a retired special forces colonel working for the U.S. Agency for International Development, told the troops that it was part of their mission to listen closely to the local people in order to learn why a town was dominated by insurgents and to figure out what to do about it. “Tie your actions to the root causes of instability,” he said. 
In 2010, Army Maj. Gen. Michael Flynn (yes, that Michael Flynn), then a senior intelligence officer in Afghanistan, wrote a stinging critique of the military’s failure to collect and act on information about the local drivers of violence and insurgent influence. “Lethal targeting alone will not help U.S. and allied forces win in Afghanistan,” he wrote. Not understanding the culture ― we continue to make that mistake over and over, in Vietnam, in Iraq and Afghanistan. Brendan Mulvaney, who teaches at the National Defense University 
For years, however, these ideas were overwhelmed by the more urgent push to defeat the enemy on the battlefield. Attacking the root causes of war was relegated to a lower priority. It was too hard to figure out, some combat commanders said, and it took too long. With deployments lasting a year or less, there was no incentive to invest in a project that might take five years to pay off. 
“Not understanding the culture ― we continue to make that mistake over and over, in Vietnam, in Iraq and Afghanistan,” said Brendan Mulvaney, a former Marine helicopter gunship pilot and foreign area officer who teaches at the U.S. Air Force Air War College and the National Defense University. 
He led a recent study for the Army on how “we screwed up in Iraq and how not to do that again.” It requires “having people outside the typical military planning process, looking from a social-political-economic-cultural lens,” he said. 
That work can still be dangerous. “If you are helping people build stability, you are taking power away from insurgents,” said a special forces officer just returned from Afghanistan. “Mother Teresa would have been beheaded out there.” 
But now, as Washington wrestles with how to bring America’s longest wars to a successful close, acceptance of this smart-power approach is growing within the military. At the training base in Twentynine Palms, California, Marines are learning to analyze the particular local drivers of violence and to bring nonlethal resources to bear against those trends. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis ― who is a mentor to Jake Harriman ― has spoken out in favor of more nonlethal programs. And in February, 121 retired generals and admirals appealed to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to reject Trump administration proposals to slash State Department funding. Srdjan Zivulovic/Reuters Families fleeing violence in Syria, here huddled around a fire at a makeshift camp in Slovenia in 2015, are easy prey for extremists who promise food, shelter and adventure. 
There’s already too little government support for tackling the underlying causes of violence. “People always say the right things” about conflict prevention, “but actually getting the resources is a hard thing,” a senior U.S. official told HuffPost, acknowledging that his ability to support the work of Richmond, Harriman and others is “shrinking.” 
The Trump administration has not yet released its new national security strategy, promised months ago, so it’s not known how Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson plan to balance raw military force with a smart-power focus on causes of conflict. The Trump budget, issued this week, would slash funds for nonlethal intervention ― although Congress has already made clear it won’t blindly accept his plan. 
Defense Department officials are currently allowed to transfer funds from their own combat operations to more diplomatic programs funded by the State Department. There is a limit to those transfers: $75 million, out of the Pentagon’s $606 billion budget this year. 
That leaves Jake Harriman seeking private financing to expand his work into northern Nigeria, where communities are threatened by the extremist group Boko Haram. So far, his most reliable funding has come from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. 
“Right now we’re trying to elevate the visibility of this problem to get the Defense Department and State to collaborate more effectively to tackle these violent extremist groups,” he said, adding, “All we need is the funding.” Courtesy of Nuru International Jake Harriman talks to agriculture field manager James Magaigwa Chacha in Kenya. Nuru's development projects are locally owned and operated. 
Federal money for similar programs hangs in the balance, and some organizations have already gone elsewhere for support. 
In Somalia, researchers for Mercy Corps, an international humanitarian aid agency, found that kids were more likely to support violence if they were in school. A Mercy Corps program helped improve the quality of the schools, trained children in team-building and leadership skills, and got them involved in student-led community action programs such as hygiene education campaigns. Researchers subsequently reported a 14 percent drop in the likelihood of youth participating in political violence and a 20 percent drop in youth supporting violence. 
The program in Somalia is underwritten by USAID, which, like the rest of the State Department, would see its budget drop by one-third in Trump’s spending plan. It is unclear whether Congress will defend those funds. 
In Iraq, where intense fighting has managed to clear ISIS from cities like Fallujah and much of Mosul, the U.S. has supported short-term “stabilization” programs that have helped 1.7 million people return to their homes, according to Brett McGurk, special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition. Much of that effort has involved clearing mines and unexploded ordnance. 
Longer-term work to prevent a return to violence is being left to non-governmental organizations. For instance, Mercy Corps has trained 87 community leaders in dispute resolution, mediation and negotiation to defuse local conflicts between religious sects, landowners, political candidates, even between rival army and police units. Development Transformations is setting up a network of grassroots groups to monitor and head off retribution attacks against Iraqis suspected of having collaborated with the extremists. The latter is being funded by Canada. 
The value of such investments in building stability may be hard to measure, but not impossible. “We’re running this as a business,” said Harriman. His team in Kenya has trained local participants to track indicators of success, such as increases in crop yields, group savings, micro-lending and loan repayments, declines in infant mortality, completion of literacy classes and leadership training. 
“This is a 5-, 10-, 15-year strategy,” Harriman concedes. But he is eager to take the model he’s tested in Kenya and expand into Nigeria and beyond. 
“Our enemy, the violent extremist groups, are innovating at a rapid speed,” he said. “We have to get ahead of these guys and reach these vulnerable populations before they do.” 
Language has been adjusted to better explain the results of a Mercy Corps program in Somalia’s schools.

Lilly Workneh,Oprah Celebrates Magical Young Black Women By Attending Their Grad Ceremonies,"05/25/2017 01:27 pm ET | Updated 5 days ago Oprah Celebrates Magical Young Black Women By Attending Their Grad Ceremonies She is supporting nine girls graduating from American colleges and universities who attended her school in South Africa. By Lilly Workneh 
Oprah may be the epitome of black girl magic but even she can’t get enough of the amazing accomplishments from young black girls around the country. So she’s joining in on the celebration. 
This graduation season, the queen of media herself is going to commencement ceremonies for all of the young women who attended the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy in South Africa and are graduating from American colleges or universities this year. 
Oprah ― who opened the academy in 2007 to provide young women in the country with an opportunity to learn, grow and graduate high school ― said she wants to support each of the nine academy alumni who will receive college degrees in the U.S. this year, marking a special moment not just for the girls but one for Oprah, too. 
“Seeing these students walk across the stage at graduation and accept their diploma – I am filled with a pride I didn’t know existed,” Oprah told HuffPost. “I would have to say it’s one the biggest rewards in my life – to see these girls become the women I always knew they would become.” A post shared by Oprah (@oprah) on May 19, 2017 at 6:47pm PDT 
So far, Oprah has traveled across states to attend six graduation ceremonies, three of which she was chosen to be a guest commencement speaker, including: Agnes Scott College, Smith College, and Skidmore college. She also attended ceremonies at Johnson C. Smith University, Elon University, and Colorado College. 
This is the second year that 100 percent of the OWLAG graduates who have completed their studies and earned degrees in America. There are currently 16 young women who are attending colleges or universities in the states. To date, there is a total of 393 OWLAG graduates who have gone to colleges and universities around the world and 310 students who are currently in attendance. A post shared by Oprah (@oprah) on May 13, 2017 at 4:14pm PDT 
Over the years, Oprah says she has done her best to establish strong relationships with each of the girls. They call her “Mom Oprah” and she calls them her “daughter girls.” They also text and FaceTime her frequently and try to visit her during holidays, building a special bond with an inspirational woman who not only looks like them but who also provides them with opportunities to help them each live their best lives. 
“I opened my school for girls in South Africa because it has been shown throughout the world that when you impact a girl’s life through education, that opportunity is given back to her, her family and her community,” Oprah said. 
“I have always tried to be there for my girls over the years, spending time with them, talking about their hopes, fears and aspirations, and sharing life lessons I’ve learned along the way,” she added. “I want them to know they have my support in all of the big and smallest of ways.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST",english,,,,,"lilly workneh  oprah , huffpost , oprah , skidmore , ","u.s. , america , south africa , ",,"et oprah celebrates magical young black , oprah celebrates magical young black , ",,"elon university , agnes scott college , colorado college , oprah winfrey leadership academy , johnson c. smith university , smith college , facetime , ",http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOgSgxnomGLIs7Fo3yTxBXpLIH9x7nQm5azWgqkkJwpTVW1O0yn4rSFeqow1uluPuwuMJJCbENNneYyelHsb_5pJFIE2QpWvGE_NLn6hEbZgkBKmKyCPhf3DkJM42r.vBKzzRxuj0NVn3zxJ28nhdbLM,Oprah Celebrates Magical Young Black Women By Attending Their Grad Ceremonies,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/index.xml,The Huffington Post | The Full Feed,2017-05-26T01:27:00.000+03:00,0,1,news,huffingtonpost.com,US,http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/1910_1000/59270a141600002100ddcd2c.png,4,
Curtis M. Wong,"Queer Characters Are Woefully Underrepresented On The Big Screen, Report Finds","Queer Characters Are Woefully Underrepresented On The Big Screen, Report Finds A new GLAAD study examines a troubling reality for LGBTQ people in Hollywood. By Curtis M. Wong Gabe Ginsberg via Getty Images Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" featured one of 2016's most-buzzed-about queer moments, but as a whole, it wasn't a great year for LGBTQ people on the big screen. 
“ Moonlight ” proved to be the little movie that could this year, winning Best Picture over the splashy, big budget musical “ La La Land ” at the Academy Awards in February. 
Seeing an independent, coming-of-age tale that tackled homophobia, racism and patriarchal norms clean up at the Oscars felt like a victory on many levels. However, a new report finds that the film’s success was very much an anomaly, and when it comes to Hollywood and the LGBTQ community, things are not getting better. 
Despite much-buzzed-about queer moments in “ Beauty and the Beast ” and “ Star Trek Beyond ,” only 18.4 percent of 125 major movies released in 2016 featured characters who identified as LGBTQ, according to GLAAD’s 2017 Studio Responsibility Index . It’s a slight uptick from the previous year , when the report found that 17.5 percent of movies released in 2015 contained queer characters. GLAAD officials, however, say that the figure is still troubling, especially given the fact that most of the queer characters we do see are based on “outdated stereotypes” played for “cheap laughs.” 
GLAAD launched the first Studio Responsibility Index in 2012 in an effort to “map the quantity, quality, and diversity of LGBTQ characters in films released by the seven major studios,” President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis explained in her introduction to the report. Each film is evaluated not just for inclusion of queer characters, but also the presence of general LGBT content and anti-LGBT language or “humor,” according to press notes. 
This year’s edition introduced a five-point scale for ranking the films released by Disney, Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony, Universal and Warner Brothers over the 2016 calendar year. The system was revised, Ellis explained, to “hold Hollywood studios to a higher standard reflective of the LGBTQ inclusion that is thriving in other forms of media.” 
If only the studios had risen to that occasion. Disney, Sony and Lionsgate received “failing” grades, while Fox, Paramount and Warner Bros. were labeled “poor.” Universal fared slightly better, receiving an “insufficient” grade. None of the studios earned a “good” or “excellent” grade. 
Only nine of the 23 major studio films to include an LGBTQ character(s) passed GLAAD’s Vito Russo Test , which measures how those characters are presented in the context of the film in a similar way to the Bechdel Test . Once again, it was a slight uptick from last year’s report in which eight of 22 inclusive films released in 2015 passed, the lowest percentage in the study’s history. 
In order to pass the Vito Russo Test, the queer character’s presence in the film must be “tied into the plot in such a way that their removal would have a significant effect” and, as such, cannot be included only to provide colorful commentary or set up a punchline. Once again, it was a slight uptick from last year’s report in which eight of 22 inclusive films released in 2015 passed, the lowest percentage in the study’s history. 
Interestingly, the news comes at a time when television is changing the game for LGBTQ programming, thanks to shows like “ Transparent ” and “ Orange is The New Black ,” Ellis noted, making it vital for the movie industry “to step up and show the full diversity of the world that movie audiences are living in today.” 
“Films like ‘Moonlight’ prove there is a huge opportunity to not only tell LGBTQ stories worthy of Oscar gold,” she said in a press release, “but to open the hearts and minds of audiences here and around the world in places where these stories can be a lifeline to the people who need it most.”

Julia Brucculieri,'America's Got Talent' Producers Sued After Tyra Banks Accused Of Verbally Abusing Girl,"05/25/2017 01:16 pm ET 'America's Got Talent' Producers Sued After Tyra Banks Accused Of Verbally Abusing Girl In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, a woman claims Banks “physically manipulated and verbally abused” her daughter. By Julia Brucculieri 
Tyra Banks ’ time on “ America’s Got Talent ” is already getting off to a shaky start, and the first episode of the new season hasn’t even aired yet. 
The supermodel, who replaced Nick Cannon as host of the talent competition show, is at the center of a lawsuit, filed Tuesday, against Marathon Productions, which produces “AGT.” 
According to the suit , obtained by Deadline, a woman identifying as Jane Doe claims her young daughter, Mary Doe, was “ physically manipulated and verbally abused ” by Banks during a March 19 performance. 
Jane claims she and her husband, who were performing a song about motherhood in front of the judges and some audience members, were “publicly humiliated.” She also claims Banks “physically manipulated and verbally abused Mary” by shaking the girl’s shoulder, pulling her hair back and insinuating she was conceived accidentally. Mary did not stop Banks because she is said to have been “fearful.” 
Jane also alleges the former “America’s Next Top Model” host made fun of the couple’s performance and ridiculed the song, which she says is “especially favored” by Mary, in front of the girl and while cameras were rolling. Dave Kotinsky via Getty Images 
The suit notes Banks asked Mary to share her opinion of her parents, after they had been ridiculed, and claims the girl was “traumatized and became deeply depressed” after her experience with Banks. 
A few weeks after the performance, Jane requested “AGT” refrain from televising any footage of her, her husband and Mary. Marathon agreed not to feature Mary on the show and acknowledged the girl’s “emotional distress.” Jane requested a second time that all footage of herself, her husband and Mary be left off the show, but she alleges Marathon “maintained that they will exploit footages of Jane and her husband, and that they will not air those footages in their entirety.” 
Jane is seeking a jury trial for the case and in her suit claims Banks (acting on behalf of Marathon and “AGT”) “knowingly, willfully and with malicious intent, initiated a harmful and offensive physical contact with Mary’s person.” 
Jane is looking for an unspecified amount in punitive damages, which will be “determined by proof at trial.” 
HuffPost has reached out to Marathon and a representative for Banks and will update this post accordingly.

Carolina Moreno,Portland Burrito Cart Closes After Owners Are Accused Of Cultural Appropriation,"Portland Burrito Cart Closes After Owners Are Accused Of Cultural Appropriation Critics say the women bragged about stealing recipes while in Mexico. By Carolina Moreno 
Two Portland-based women were forced to shut down their burrito food cart over accusations of cultural appropriation and recipe stealing. 
Liz “LC” Connelly and Kali Wilgus’ Kooks Burritos business was featured in the Willamette Week on May 16. During the interview, Connelly described how the duo made their own tortillas after taking a trip to Puerto Nuevo, Mexico, in December and obtaining information on the process. 
The method by which the two non-Hispanic white women obtained the information on tortilla making is questionable. 
“I picked the brains of every tortilla lady there in the worst broken Spanish ever, and they showed me a little of what they did,” Connelly told the Willamette Week. “They told us the basic ingredients, and we saw them moving and stretching the dough similar to how pizza makers do before rolling it out with rolling pins.” Update: Kooks Burritos has closed. No brunch this weekend. https://t.co/So3o7NB3xX — Willamette Week ?? (@wweek) May 20, 2017 
But Connelly also noted that many of the Mexican women were hesitant to give away their methods ― a fact that didn’t stop them from trying to gather more information. 
“They wouldn’t tell us too much about technique, but we were peeking into the windows of every kitchen, totally fascinated by how easy they made it look,” Connelly said. “We learned quickly it isn’t quite that easy.” 
Once back in Portland, Connelly said she went to the Mexican market to buy ingredients and recreated the tortillas to the best of her ability with trial and error. The two women opened up their food cart on Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard . 
Mic.com’s Jamilah King responded to the Willamette Week interview with a piece Friday calling out the women for “stealing recipes from Mexico to start a Portland business.” 
“The problem, of course, is that it’s unclear whether the Mexican women who handed over their recipes ever got anything in return,” King wrote in the piece that also outlined how others had begun to accuse the women of cultural appropriation. “And now those same recipes are being sold as a delicacy in Portland.” 
That same day, the Willamette Week tweeted an update that Kooks Burritos had closed . 
While the food cart’s online presence quickly disappeared, the business’s Yelp page is still active (with an “active cleanup alert” that monitors comments based on the spike in activity due to news reports). Both supporters and critics have sounded off on the page. 
“How would you people feel if I went and spied on your family or business recipes and took it somewhere else for my own financial benefit?” Olivia L. from Portland wrote in a Yelp review. “This is stealing.” 
Supporters, however, have pointed to how common it is within the culinary world and food industry to take methods and ingredients from other countries and profit off of them. 
Writer Jagger Blaec weighed in on the controversy in The Portland Mercury on Monday, saying “Portland has an appropriation problem” and breaking down how the issue is a reflection of a bigger problem within the city. 
“Several of the most successful businesses in this town have been birthed as a result of curious white people going to a foreign country, or an international venture, and poaching as many trade secrets, customs, recipes as possible, and then coming back to Portland to claim it as their own and score a tidy profit,” Blaec wrote. “Now don’t get me wrong: cultural customs are meant to be shared. However, that’s not what happens in this city.” 
“Because of Portland’s underlying racism, the people who rightly own these traditions and cultures that exist are already treated poorly,” the writer continues. “These appropriating businesses are erasing and exploiting their already marginalized identities for the purpose of profit and praise.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST 21 Foods We Get From Mexico 21 Foods We Get From Mexico 21 Foods We Get From Mexico 1 21 Oreos Donald Trump personally boycotted Oreos in 2015 after parent company Mondelez announced they would move some of their production to Mexico.

President Donald Trump attended the NATO summit in Brussels on Thursday, where he tried his best to settle in among his fellow world leaders. 
The whole event seemed to have a new-kid-at-school feel for Trump. But every class has a bully, and reports suggest the president made some effort to embrace that role. 
He began the day with a confrontational address, in which he chided NATO allies for not spending enough on defense. Others looked on with, well, whatever these expressions are: *Look at their faces* and the whispering as Trump admonishes leaders over NATO financial obligations. pic.twitter.com/gLCYgKTdi3 — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) May 25, 2017

The man Trump seemed to push past is Montenegro Prime Minister Dusko Markovic, whose nation is set to join NATO in June ― much to the displeasure of Russian President Vladimir Putin . It appears the man Trump shoved aside was Prime Minister Dusko Markovic of Montenegro, the newest NATO member, directly threatened by Putin — Greg Pinelo (@gregpinelo) May 25, 2017 
The Washington Post’s Philip Rucker described the ensuing NATO “family photo” in a pool report that confirmed Trump is unlikely to win any most-popular awards. 
“Some of the leaders interacted with one another on stage, but not Trump,” he wrote. “He stood silently, shifting his stance at moments and looking around.” 
And when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau encouraged the group to wave, “some followed Trudeau’s command, but not Trump, who did not raise an arm.” 
“Trump smiled for a brief moment, but otherwise kept a serious, perhaps even stern, expression on his face for the duration of the photo opp,” according to Rucker. 
The world leaders began to disperse after the photos were taken. Some remained on stage to mingle, but Trump did not. 
“Your pooler did not see any leaders approach Trump or talk with him on his way out,” Rucker wrote.

Jenna Amatulli,Girl Accuses Teacher Of 'War Crimes' In Hilarious Year-End Review,"05/25/2017 12:58 pm ET Girl Accuses Teacher Of 'War Crimes' In Hilarious Year-End Review The 11-year-old cited the 1949 Geneva Conventions in her answer to ""things my teachers can do better."" By Jenna Amatulli 
Ava Morrison-Bell is an 11-year-old from the UK with a whole lot of moxie. 
Morrison-Bell was asked to fill out a form for school with questions for students about their teachers. One asked how teachers can do better. 
The conscientious Bell suggested that they “not use collective punishment” as it is not fair for the people who “did nothing,” as per a tweet of the response by her father Mason Cross. 
She goes even further to cite the “1949 Genva Conventions” as evidence that this behavior is “a war crime.” My daughter actually submitted this feedback at school. Not sure if I should ground her or buy her ice cream... pic.twitter.com/4v8Gjb9riv — Mason Cross (@MasonCrossBooks) May 25, 2017 
Undoubtedly, Bell means the Geneva Conventions, a series of international treaties established between 1864 and 1949. Most intriguingly, she’s referencing the 1949 Protocol II within the Conventions that “ prohibited collective punishment.” 
Granted, that protocol also prohibits torture, the taking of hostages, acts of terrorism, slavery, rape, enforced prostitution, etc., but the point is salient: Bell doesn’t want to be held responsible for things she didn’t do. 
Cross told HuffPost that his daughter “said very positive things in the other answer” and that her teacher responded to her answer with “a dignified silence.” I should clarify that she thinks her teacher is awesome - it's just this aspect of the educational justice system she has an issue with. — Mason Cross (@MasonCrossBooks) May 25, 2017 
Additionally, Cross said that this wasn’t even the only time his daughter has mentioned the Geneva Conventions in casual conversation. 
“She also cites minimum wage legislation when we offer her £2 to tidy her room,” Cross told us. 
Ava, you’re the best. We can only hope you’ll become a human rights lawyer one day.

Tom Engelhardt,Forget Big Brother -- Trump Is Omnipresent,"Forget Big Brother -- Trump Is Omnipresent Can’t you feel how rickety the last superpower on planet Earth is becoming? 05/25/2017 01:00 pm ET 
Cross-posted with TomDispatch.com 
In the first paragraphs of George Orwell’s famed novel 1984 , Winston Smith slips through the doors of his apartment building, “Victory Mansions,” to escape a “vile wind.” Hate week ― a concept that should seem eerily familiar in Donald Trump’s America ― was soon to arrive. “The hallway,” writes Orwell, “smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats.” Smith then plods up to his seventh-floor flat, since the building’s elevator rarely works even when there’s electricity, which is seldom the case. And, of course, he immediately sees the most famous poster in the history of the novel, the one in which BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU. (“It was one of those pictures, so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move.”) 
Now, imagine us inside our own “Victory Mansions,” an increasingly ramshackle place called the United States of America in which, like Smith, we simply can’t escape our leader. Call him perhaps “Big Muddler.” He may not be looking directly at YOU, but he is, thanks to a never-ending media frenzy, remarkably omnipresent. Go ahead and try, but you know that whatever you do, however you live your life, these days you just can’t escape him. And if Donald Trump’s America isn’t already starting to feel a little like that ill-named, run-down building in a future, poverty-stricken London, then tell me what it’s like. 
Can’t you feel how rickety the last superpower on planet Earth is becoming as our very own Big-Muddler-in-Chief praises himself eternally for his “achievements”? Here’s just a small sample from a recent graduation address President Trump gave at the Coast Guard Academy. (You know, the one where he so classically claimed that “no politician in history ― and I say this with great surety ― has been treated worse or more unfairly”): 
“I’ve accomplished a tremendous amount in a very short time as president. Jobs pouring back into our country... We’ve saved the Second Amendment, expanded service for our veterans... I’ve loosened up the strangling environmental chains wrapped around our country and our economy, chains so tight that you couldn’t do anything ― that jobs were going down... We’ve begun plans and preparations for the border wall, which is going along very, very well. We’re working on major tax cuts for all... And we’re also getting closer and closer, day by day, to great healthcare for our citizens.” 
This is, of course, all balderdash ― from the “big, fat, beautiful wall ” the Mexicans were going to finance, for which he’s requested $1.6 billion in the next budget (compared to the up to $67 billion it might actually cost) and which he’s unlikely to get, to those scam jobs supposedly flooding in thanks to him. His urge is clearly to establish a fantasy America, a true Victory Mansion (undoubtedly with his name in golden letters above it) in the potential ruins of the country we once knew, which would indeed be an Orwellian trick of the first order. In the meantime, as TomDispatch regular Rebecca Gordon points out, President Trump and his coterie of cabinet plutocrats and advisers have been doing Orwell one better and, 33 years after 1984 passed us by, are in the process of creating their own memory hole down which they plan to stuff reality itself.

JamesMichael Nichols,Ben & Jerry's Bans Same-Flavored Scoops Until Australia Passes Marriage Equality,"Ben & Jerry's Bans Same-Flavored Scoops Until Australia Passes Marriage Equality ""No marriage equality, no same flavor scoops!"" 26/05/2017 2:52 AM AEST | Updated 26/05/2017 6:34 AM AEST James Michael Nichols HuffPost Queer Voices Deputy Editor Courtesy of Ben Jerrys 
Ben & Jerry’s is coming for Australian’s taste buds, announcing a pledge that no one in Oz can order two scoops of the same flavor until marriage equality becomes law of the land Down Under. 
Ben & Jerry’s currently operates 26 stores across the nation, and is placing the ban on same-flavored scoops as a statement of opposition to the country’s stance on same-sex marriage, where it is currently illegal for two men or two women to wed. The “ban”is part of the company’s push for global LGBTQ rights. 
Currently 70 percent of Australians support same-sex marriage, and the push for its legalization is an ongoing conversation in the country. 
“We are proud to be standing alongside The Equality Campaign to continue the fight for marriage equality in Australia,” Imogen Rugg, Ben & Jerry’s Australia spokesperson, said in a statement to HuffPost. “Ben & Jerry’s has a long and proud history of commitment to social justice, including LGBTQI rights and marriage equality. This commitment is grounded in our company’s core values and an unshakable belief that everyone deserves full and equal civil rights.” Courtesy of Ben Jerrys 
In conjunction with the ban on same-flavored scoops, Ben & Jerry’s has also established a postal system of sorts across its Australian stores. Customers and supporters of marriage equality can write messages advocating for the legalization of same-sex marriage, with Ben & Jerry’s staff prepared to deliver their messages directly to local MPs. 
Ben & Jerry’s aims to have all messages from customers delivered before the final parliamentary session of the season on June 13th . 
Ben & Jerry’s has long used its product to create high-visibility statements of support in the fight for LGBTQ rights on a global level. In 2015, the company renamed its beloved Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough flavor to “I Dough, I Dough” in celebration of America legalizing same-sex marriage. The company made a similar move in 2012 in the UK, renaming their “Oh! My! Apple Pie!” flavor “Apple-y Ever After” in support of coalitions pushing for the legalization of same-sex marriage throughout England.

The Huffington Post News Team,This Military Vet Has Found A Smarter Way To Fight The War On Terror,"These Military Vets Have Found A Smarter Way To Fight The War On Terror “We just can’t keep killing our way out of this problem.” By David Wood 
During four hard combat tours as a Marine commander, Jake Harriman began to understand why the United States is failing to eradicate violent Islamic extremism. 
Individual heroics and immense sacrifice over 16 years have enabled American combat troops and special forces to win their battles with the Taliban, al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Those extremist militias are virtually powerless against U.S. drones and airstrikes, which have killed dozens of senior leaders. But still, jihadist movements persist and grow. 
Afghan kids keep joining the Taliban, which controls a growing swath of Afghanistan. ISIS, despite battlefield setbacks, recruits passionate believers in Syria, Afghanistan and Libya, not to mention Manchester, England, and Minneapolis . Extremist militias across Africa, around the Middle East and in Southeast Asia draw volunteers. And terrorism continues. 
What Jake Harriman and his fellow Marines saw was that the United States, for all its battlefield prowess, does not recognize or act on the causes of violence. 
But the extremists do. 
“We were going out every night on these snatch-and-grab missions and we began to see we were taking three steps forward, two steps back. The guys we were fighting were out in these villages winning hearts and minds,” Harriman, 42, told HuffPost. “They were dropping off food, they were building schools, they were building clinics. And yes, they were horribly oppressive. But these vulnerable populations were so impoverished that the parents had no other choices to feed their kids.” Courtesy of Nuru International Jake Harriman began developing his ideas on what defeats extremists and what doesn't during four combat tours in Iraq and southwest Asia. 
Standing in dusty battle gear in the desolate Iraqi landscape a decade ago, Harriman was struck by this epiphany: Military force alone isn’t going to obliterate extremist violence. In his words, “We just can’t keep killing our way out of this problem.” 
Convinced he could do better, Harriman resigned his Marine commission, earned a graduate business degree at Stanford University, formed a company and moved to southwest Kenya. He went into the rural villages where he thought deep poverty might not cause violent extremism, but was likely providing fertile ground for the militias. There, he found impoverished farmers so desperate that they would support or even join al-Shabab, the Somalia-based extremist militia, for whatever help it might offer. The guys we were fighting were out in these villages winning hearts and minds. Jake Harriman, a former Marine commander in Iraq 
What’s different about Harriman’s approach from that of traditional aid efforts is that he combines the gritty realism of the warfighter with the data-driven analytics of the business entrepreneur. 
Over seven years, Harriman and his Kenyan co-workers have helped organize locally owned and operated cooperatives that enable families to rise above subsistence farming, by marketing their excess crops and saving money in a communal banking system from which they can draw loans to expand their farms. His organization, Nuru International , has aided 85,000 people, he said, and blunted the appeal of the jihadis. 
“We began to have an impact in these gangs’ ability to recruit, by giving options to the young men” in the villages, Harriman said. “Now they could actually feed their families. They could actually have farming as a business. They now had a future … that diminished the gangs’ abilities to recruit in these rural areas.” 
Jake Harriman is one of a number of Americans who worked in the Iraq and Afghanistan war zones and came away convinced that the United States needs a better plan of engagement for places vulnerable to extremist recruiting. America, they argue, needs to rely less on military power and more on “smart power.” Lasting change, they say, depends on intimate knowledge of the local population, understanding why people there turn to violence, and designing narrowly focused interventions to help. 
Now if they can just get the funding to carry on. STEFAN HEUNIS/AFP/Getty Images Extreme poverty and malnutrition in parts of Nigeria enable extremist militias such as Boko Haram to attract recruits and support. 
Unlike traditional global development programs, the new reformers are using microdata to document the precise local causes of instability and to measure the impact of the resources invested in specific areas. 
In the southern Philippines, former Green Beret Justin Richmond found a farming community where impoverished kids were joining the ISIS affiliate for money. He helped set up a village co-op and invest in a solar dryer for harvested rice and corn. Five tons of produce were saved from rotting and sold, and the profits were re-invested. The next time terrorist recruiters showed up, he said, the townspeople told them to get lost and called in the military. 
In Libya, Development Transformations , which has several former members of the U.S. military among its leadership team, monitors the social media of extremist militias. With the aid of data processing and analysis firms ZignalLabs and DEV Results , the Washington, D.C.-based group designs counter-messaging initiatives and tracks any resulting change in local attitudes. 
“You don’t just want to know that the enemy is there, but why he is there,” said M. Shands Pickett, a company director who spent three years in Afghanistan as part of U.S. military intelligence and counterterrorism operations. “If you shoot him in the face, there are more coming, and there is an infinite supply of enemy and a finite supply of us,” he told HuffPost. 
“But if you can begin to answer why the enemy is there and understand the sources of instability in that particular place, then you don’t have to shoot so many of them in the face,” said Pickett. 
This generation of war-hardened activists sees their work not necessarily as a replacement for military intervention, but as a critical element of the larger U.S. strategy. Their ideas are not entirely new, but they’ve struggled to gain the ear of the national security establishment. 
Some people listened. In 2008, for instance, State Department experts and special forces soldiers were teaching counterinsurgency techniques at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to troops bound for Iraq and Afghanistan. Thomas Baltazar, a retired special forces colonel working for the U.S. Agency for International Development, told the troops that it was part of their mission to listen closely to the local people in order to learn why a town was dominated by insurgents and to figure out what to do about it. “Tie your actions to the root causes of instability,” he said. 
In 2010, Army Maj. Gen. Michael Flynn (yes, that Michael Flynn), then a senior intelligence officer in Afghanistan, wrote a stinging critique of the military’s failure to collect and act on information about the local drivers of violence and insurgent influence. “Lethal targeting alone will not help U.S. and allied forces win in Afghanistan,” he wrote. Not understanding the culture ― we continue to make that mistake over and over, in Vietnam, in Iraq and Afghanistan. Brendan Mulvaney, who teaches at the National Defense University 
For years, however, these ideas were overwhelmed by the more urgent push to defeat the enemy on the battlefield. Attacking the root causes of war was relegated to a lower priority. It was too hard to figure out, some combat commanders said, and it took too long. With deployments lasting a year or less, there was no incentive to invest in a project that might take five years to pay off. 
“Not understanding the culture ― we continue to make that mistake over and over, in Vietnam, in Iraq and Afghanistan,” said Brendan Mulvaney, a former Marine helicopter gunship pilot and foreign area officer who teaches at the U.S. Air Force Air War College and the National Defense University. 
He led a recent study for the Army on how “we screwed up in Iraq and how not to do that again.” It requires “having people outside the typical military planning process, looking from a social-political-economic-cultural lens,” he said. 
That work can still be dangerous. “If you are helping people build stability, you are taking power away from insurgents,” said a special forces officer just returned from Afghanistan. “Mother Teresa would have been beheaded out there.” 
But now, as Washington wrestles with how to bring America’s longest wars to a successful close, acceptance of this smart-power approach is growing within the military. At the training base in Twentynine Palms, California, Marines are learning to analyze the particular local drivers of violence and to bring nonlethal resources to bear against those trends. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis ― who is a mentor to Jake Harriman ― has spoken out in favor of more nonlethal programs. And in February, 121 retired generals and admirals appealed to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to reject Trump administration proposals to slash State Department funding. Srdjan Zivulovic/Reuters Families fleeing violence in Syria, here huddled around a fire at a makeshift camp in Slovenia in 2015, are easy prey for extremists who promise food, shelter and adventure. 
There’s already too little government support for tackling the underlying causes of violence. “People always say the right things” about conflict prevention, “but actually getting the resources is a hard thing,” a senior U.S. official told HuffPost, acknowledging that his ability to support the work of Richmond, Harriman and others is “shrinking.” 
The Trump administration has not yet released its new national security strategy, promised months ago, so it’s not known how Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson plan to balance raw military force with a smart-power focus on causes of conflict. The Trump budget, issued this week, would slash funds for nonlethal intervention ― although Congress has already made clear it won’t blindly accept his plan. 
Defense Department officials are currently allowed to transfer funds from their own combat operations to more diplomatic programs funded by the State Department. There is a limit to those transfers: $75 million, out of the Pentagon’s $606 billion budget this year. 
That leaves Jake Harriman seeking private financing to expand his work into northern Nigeria, where communities are threatened by the extremist group Boko Haram. So far, his most reliable funding has come from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. 
“Right now we’re trying to elevate the visibility of this problem to get the Defense Department and State to collaborate more effectively to tackle these violent extremist groups,” he said, adding, “All we need is the funding.” Courtesy of Nuru International Jake Harriman talks to agriculture field manager James Magaigwa Chacha in Kenya. Nuru's development projects are locally owned and operated. 
Federal money for similar programs hangs in the balance, and some organizations have already gone elsewhere for support. 
In Somalia, researchers for Mercy Corps, an international humanitarian aid agency, found that kids were more likely to participate in violence if they were in school. A Mercy Corps program helped improve the quality of the schools, trained children in team-building and leadership skills, and got them involved in student-led community action programs such as hygiene education campaigns. Researchers subsequently reported a 16 percent drop in the likelihood of youth supporting political violence. 
The program in Somalia is underwritten by USAID, which, like the rest of the State Department, would see its budget drop by one-third in Trump’s spending plan. It is unclear whether Congress will defend those funds. 
In Iraq, where intense fighting has managed to clear ISIS from cities like Fallujah and much of Mosul, the U.S. has supported short-term “stabilization” programs that have helped 1.7 million people return to their homes, according to Brett McGurk, special envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition. Much of that effort has involved clearing mines and unexploded ordnance. 
Longer-term work to prevent a return to violence is being left to non-governmental organizations. For instance, Mercy Corps has trained 87 community leaders in dispute resolution, mediation and negotiation to defuse local conflicts between religious sects, landowners, political candidates, even between rival army and police units. Development Transformations is setting up a network of grassroots groups to monitor and head off retribution attacks against Iraqis suspected of having collaborated with the extremists. The latter is being funded by Canada. 
The value of such investments in building stability may be hard to measure, but not impossible. “We’re running this as a business,” said Harriman. His team in Kenya has trained local participants to track indicators of success, such as increases in crop yields, group savings, micro-lending and loan repayments, declines in infant mortality, completion of literacy classes and leadership training. 
“This is a 5-, 10-, 15-year strategy,” Harriman concedes. But he is eager to take the model he’s tested in Kenya and expand into Nigeria and beyond. 
“Our enemy, the violent extremist groups, are innovating at a rapid speed,” he said. “We have to get ahead of these guys and reach these vulnerable populations before they do.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

The Huffington Post News Team,Girl Accuses Teacher Of 'War Crimes' In Hilarious Year-End Review,"05/25/2017 12:58 pm ET Girl Accuses Teacher Of 'War Crimes' In Hilarious Year-End Review The 11-year-old cited the 1949 Geneva Conventions in her answer to ""things my teachers can do better."" By Jenna Amatulli 
Ava Morrison-Bell is an 11-year-old from the UK with a whole lot of moxie. 
Morrison-Bell was asked to fill out a form for school with questions for students about their teachers. One asked how teachers can do better. 
The conscientious Bell suggested that they “not use collective punishment” as it is not fair for the people who “did nothing,” as per a tweet of the response by her father Mason Cross. 
She goes even further to cite the “1949 Genva Conventions” as evidence that this behavior is “a war crime.” My daughter actually submitted this feedback at school. Not sure if I should ground her or buy her ice cream... pic.twitter.com/4v8Gjb9riv — Mason Cross (@MasonCrossBooks) May 25, 2017 
Undoubtedly, Bell means the Geneva Conventions, a series of international treaties established between 1864 and 1949. Most intriguingly, she’s referencing the 1949 Protocol II within the Conventions that “ prohibited collective punishment.” 
Granted, that protocol also prohibits torture, the taking of hostages, acts of terrorism, slavery, rape, enforced prostitution, etc., but the point is salient: Bell doesn’t want to be held responsible for things she didn’t do. 
Cross told HuffPost that his daughter “said very positive things in the other answer” and that her teacher responded to her answer with “a dignified silence.” I should clarify that she thinks her teacher is awesome - it's just this aspect of the educational justice system she has an issue with. — Mason Cross (@MasonCrossBooks) May 25, 2017 
Additionally, Cross said that this wasn’t even the only time his daughter has mentioned the Geneva Conventions in casual conversation. 
“She also cites minimum wage legislation when we offer her £2 to tidy her room,” Cross told us. 
Ava, you’re the best. We can only hope you’ll become a human rights lawyer one day.

Cristian Farias,Appeals Court Slaps Down Donald Trump's Travel Ban Yet Again | HuffPost,"Appeals Court Slaps Down Donald Trump's Travel Ban Yet Again The court said that the president's executive order ""drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination."" 25/05/2017 11:26 PM IST | Updated 26/05/2017 3:16 AM IST Cristian Farias Legal Affairs Reporter, HuffPost ADVERTISEMENT 
In yet another setback for the Trump administration, a federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, on Thursday refused to lift a nationwide injunction that halted a key provision of President Donald Trump ’s revised travel ban on six predominantly Muslim nations . 
The ruling is the most bruising the White House has suffered in its attempts to defend the ban, as it was rendered by 13 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit — which deemed the case important enough to skip the usual three-judge process that the vast majority of cases go through. 
U.S. Chief Circuit Judge Roger Gregory wrote that the text of Trump’s executive order, which was challenged in courts across the country for targeting members of a particular faith, “speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.” 
“Congress granted the President broad power to deny entry to aliens, but that power is not absolute,” Gregory wrote in a ruling that largely upheld the original block on the travel ban. “It cannot go unchecked when, as here, the President wields it through an executive edict that stands to cause irreparable harm to individuals across this nation.” 
Ten of the judges who heard the case, all of them appointed by Democratic presidents, voted to keep Trump’s travel restrictions on hold. Of the 10, Gregory had the court’s majority decision and four of his colleagues issued individual opinions that offered different grounds, some narrower than others, for concluding that the travel ban is likely invalid under immigration law and the Constitution. 
“Laid bare, this Executive Order is no more than what the President promised before and after his election: naked invidious discrimination against Muslims,” wrote U.S. Circuit Judge James Wynn in a concurrence. “Such discrimination contravenes the authority Congress delegated to the President in the Immigration and Nationality Act ... and it is unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause.” 
The three dissenting judges, all Republican appointees, wrote separate opinions condemning the ruling, each offering different reasons why Trump’s executive order is lawful. One of them, U.S. Circuit Judge Dennis Shedd, lamented “the larger ramifications of this decision” for the nation’s safety. 
“Regrettably, at the end of the day, the real losers in this case are the millions of individual Americans whose security is threatened on a daily basis by those who seek to do us harm,” Shedd wrote. 
The decision clears the way for Trump to appeal to the Supreme Court, a move he promised when the first version of the travel ban was shot down. The appeal never materialized then — the administration chose instead to start from scratch and reissue a tamer version of the executive order . 
The watered-down version — which removed Iraq from the list of barred countries and eliminated the ban on Syrian refugees — no longer applied to permanent residents and had a delayed rollout, all in hopes of avoiding the detentions, chaos and protests unleashed by the first order. 
These tweaks were intended to make the travel ban more palatable to the courts. But Trump’s campaign promises and anti-Muslim sentiment kept dogging the administration, and federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland couldn’t help but take that history into account in assessing the travel ban’s legality. Both courts concluded that Trump’s own words, and those of his surrogates , tainted the executive order with unconstitutional animus against a religious group. 
And the 4th Circuit went right along. 
“We cannot shut our eyes to such evidence when it stares us in the face, for there’s none so blind as they that won’t see,” Gregory wrote. “If and when future courts are confronted with campaign or other statements proffered as evidence of governmental purpose, those courts must similarly determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether such statements are probative evidence of governmental purpose.” 
Not every judge in the majority agreed with that conclusion, even if they agreed that Trump’s executive order likely violates the Constitution’s establishment clause , which forbids the government from expressing religious preferences. 
For example, U.S. Circuit Judge Stephanie Thacker , an Obama appointee, said that as a candidate, Trump had yet to take an “oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution,” and thus was at liberty to make wild campaign promises. But once he took office, everything he or his administration said or did was fair game. 
“Once a candidate becomes President, however, the Constitution vests that individual with the awesome power of the executive office while simultaneously imposing constraints on that power,” Thacker wrote. 
The Trump administration, for its part, has insisted that the president’s words shouldn’t be used against him, and that courts should be careful not to look behind the chief executive’s motives or second-guess his broad authority to set immigration policy. 
“The order before this court has been the subject of a heated and passionate political debate,” a Department of Justice lawyer said during oral arguments before the 4th Circuit. “But the precedent set by this case for this court’s role in reviewing the president’s power at the borders will long transcend this debate and this order and this constitutional moment.” 
Indeed, U.S. Circuit Judge Paul Niemeyer, a conservative, warned that the 4th Circuit’s focus on Trump’s past statements was creating a “new rule” unsupported by prior precedents ― all but telegraphing to the Supreme Court that they should correct the error. Anything less, he said, would give future plaintiffs “a sword” to wield religious challenges to government action, and may leave Trump powerless to implement similar executive orders at all. 
“Government officials will avoid speaking about religion, even privately, lest a court discover statements that could be used to ascribe a religious motivation to their future actions,” Niemeyer wrote. “And, in the more immediate future, our courts will be faced with the unworkable task of determining when this President’s supposed religious motive has sufficiently dissipated so as to allow executive action toward these or other majority-Muslim countries.” 
The next stop for the case, as Trump has often boasted, is the Supreme Court itself. And when that happens, it is not an understatement to say the dispute will set up one of the biggest presidential showdowns the justices will decide in modern history. 
UPDATE: 5:40 p.m. ― Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement on Thursday evening that the Justice Department “will seek review of this case in the United States Supreme Court.” 
Sessions said Trump’s order was “well within his lawful authority to keep the Nation safe” and that DOJ “strongly disagrees with the decision of the divided court, which blocks the President’s efforts to strengthen this country’s national security.” 
“As the dissenting judges explained, the executive order is a constitutional exercise of the President’s duty to protect our communities from terrorism,” Sessions said. “The President is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism, until he determines that they can be properly vetted and do not pose a security risk to the United States.”

Earl Ofari Hutchinson,Killing Of Richard Collins Again Exposes A Gaping Racial Double Standard,"Killing Of Richard Collins Again Exposes A Gaping Racial Double Standard The sequence of events in these cases is all too predictable. 05/25/2017 10:19 am ET | Updated 2 days ago 
The hideous slaying of second lieutenant Richard W. Collins III on   campus did more than evoke heartfelt grief and sorrow over the snuffing out of a young, hopeful, and high achieving young man’s life. It also again cast an ugly glare on the gaping double standard in how black lives matter versus those of white lives. Let’s go through the agonizing, but by now all too familiar, checklist of things that are terribly wrong with how his death has been treated. First, there’s the alleged assailant, Sean Urbanski, a young white man. The tributes to Collins had barely poured out at Bowie State University, where he was days from graduating, when Urbanski’s attorney not only pled innocence for his client, but implored the court to release him on his own recognizance, provide alcohol and drug testing counseling, and monitor him during his release by GPS. 
The request was denied. Then there are the charges. He is charged with first degree murder. So far so good. However, the irrefutable fact is that Collins was African-American, and Urbanski is white. He has a documented connection with an “Alt Reich: Nation” Facebook group, and there is absolutely no evidence of any provocation on the part of Collins to precipitate the murder. Now there’s the Alt-Reich group that he belonged to. Even this has been sloughed off as just a light-hearted, silly, fun-and-games attempt by some college guys to draw attention to the group. The founder of the group was given tons of ink to make the case that spewing racism and white nationalism as the furthest thing from the minds of those associated with the group, and presumably that includes Urbanski. 
Then there is Urbanski. The predictable happened. He was immediately depicted by friends and associates as a quiet, unassuming, even good-natured fellow, who couldn’t hurt a fly. All expressed shock and surprise that this seemingly good natured, all-American, clean cut good guy could commit such a dastardly crime. 
That’s not a small point. The image massage of the group as a harmless fun-loving, and satirical outing on social media by some thrill-seeking college students, not to mention the glowing depiction of Urbanski, almost takes off the table the charge that he murdered Collins out of racial malice. In other words, that the murder is a hate crime and he should be charged under state or federal law as a hate crime perpetrator. The Prince George’s County Attorney expressed doubt and hesitancy about the motive. The Justice Department has been stone silent on whether it will consider a separate hate crime prosecution of Urbanski. The argument is always why bring a hate crime charge in these cases, even if there is a racial intent? The assailant is already being charged with and will be tried on a first-degree murder count. 
This badly begs the question. A hate crime enhancement in racial assaults and murders is on the books as a deterrent and punishment to racially motivated assaults and murder. The failure to bring hate crimes charges sends the dangerous message that hate crimes, especially hate murders, will not be punished as racially driven hate crimes, but won’t even be called that even when there is compelling evidence they are. And the incidences of hate crimes have shown no sign of diminishing. Year in and year out, the FBI’s annual reports on hate crime violence in America report thousands of them. There are probably thousands more that aren’t reported. A murder charge and a conviction in racially motivated hate attacks and murders alone is hardly a disincentive stern enough to curb hate crimes. 
There is also evidence that white nationalist, white supremacist groups and the social media ravings of kooky unhinged hate mongers hold a perverse fascination for many white students on college campuses. Since Trump’s election, a CBS report found nearly 150 incidences of racist posters and fliers on college campuses in nearly three dozen states. 
But even before Trump’s election ushered in a new era of hate, intolerance, and bigotry, hardly a week went by without a report somewhere of hanging nooses, white hoods, racist graffiti, racial slurs and taunts aimed at minority students. The colleges that have been called on the carpet for the racist acts read like a who’s who of American higher education. Clemson University, Auburn, Lehigh, Tarleton State, Texas A&M, University of Texas, Austin, University of Connecticut, Johns Hopkins, Whitman College, the University of Oklahoma, U.C.L.A., U.C. San Diego, and  , to name only a very handful. The Harvard University Voices of Diversity project found campuses rife with subtle and not-so-subtle “ microaggressions “ against minority and women students. 
The final insult. The Collins slaying quickly disappeared from the headlines. 
Urbanski may or may not be charged with a hate crime. But the hesitation, doubt and apparent reluctance of officials to call racial hate racial hate, even when it’s murder, tells much about the glaring double standard in how hate crimes are dealt with.

Marcus Bright,Broken Dreams And Financial Illusions: The Secret Depression Of Black Men,"Broken Dreams And Financial Illusions: The Secret Depression Of Black Men 05/24/2017 07:20 pm ET | Updated 3 days ago Playbill 
There is a secret depression that is rooted in economics that many Black men battle. It is hidden underneath an assortment of layers including an exaggerated bravado, drug and alcohol abuse, misdirected anger, and other forms of destructive behavior. Fantastical illlusions are also a tool that is deployed to cope with the humbling realities of an often marginalized existence. 
The “Bow Wow Challenge” that took over social media earlier in the month was a reflection of a daily pattern of illusions for many. Some aspect of Bow Wow fronting like he was traveling on a private plane instead of his actual reality of flying coach on a commercial airline is frequently in operation for Black people in this country. 
For all of the trips, fancy purses, and Jordan-brand shoes the truth is that the vast majority of us are barely scraping by. Credit, celebrities, and trinkets have given many of us the illusion that we are doing much better economically than we actually are. We have been bamboozled by Facebook likes, hoodwinked by Instagram comments, and led astray by Twitter retweets. Social media has a tendency to tell you a lot of things that aren’t true. 
The data suggest that the majority of African Americans are not in a great place financially. A prime example of this is a finding from the “The Color of Wealth in Boston” report that found that the median net worth of White households in Boston is $247,500 while the median net worth of Black households is $8. 
The average net worth of a single Black woman with a bachelor’s degree is $-11,000 and the median wealth of a single Black woman without a bachelor’s degree is $0 according to a research brief entitled “Women, Race, and Wealth” by Khaing Zaw, Jhumpa Bhattacharya, Anne Price, Darrick Hamilton, and William Darity, Jr. This underscores the sad reality that getting a college degree may actually be a hindrance in some cases to a person’s wealth position because of the frequent need to go into large amounts of debt in order to obtain higher education. 
Most of the racial wealth gaps that exist are a result of the lack of intergenerational wealth transfers available for Black families based on a host of different reasons ranging from Federal Housing Administration policy, slavery, Jim Crowe laws, employment discrimination, denial of access to capital, and the list goes on and on. 
The larger point in citing these figures is that we are economically struggling because we began a figurative 100 meter dash 50 meters behind. There is an economic disadvantage for Blacks that is built into the fabric of American society. We don’t need to beat ourselves up in a desire to keep with “the Joneses”. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t strive for excellence in every realm, but it does mean that killing yourself to try to keep up with images that may or may not be real will only lead to a life of frustration. 
Black men are particularly susceptible to this kind of unhealthy pressure and stress. As they have grown into adulthood, they have seen many of their childhood dreams deferred. Jay Z articulated this in his song Izzo (H.O.V.A.) when he said “I’ve seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend’s weight.” You will frequently see people holding onto their dreams of being rap stars or NBA players well into their 30s or even 40s. It is a good thing in one sense to hold on to your dream, but the limited number of slots in those areas suggests that many of these dreams will eventually be shattered. 
The lack of a viable “Plan B” in the form of education, job training, or entrepreneurial expertise stymies some from progression. Others have gone and acquired credentials, but still seem to be locked out of gainful economic opportunity. When viable economic options are taken off of the table, then people are more apt to turn to criminal endeavors to meet immediate survival needs for them and their families. 
Black men are the most unemployed and incarcerated group in the country per capita. The jobless rate for Black men between ages of 20 and 34 in many cities including Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Baltimore is above 45% according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey . 
The psychological impact on men who haven’t been able to overcome the reality of the labor market is a story that is seldom told. Many are suffering from broken dreams and delusions of grandeur that have not been fulfilled. An argument can be made that many Black men have been suffering from a secret depression for years as a result of this financial crunch. A great deal of it probably has its roots in an economic struggle. 
I am not licensed to give a diagnosis of depression, but I can give some reasons that Black men may feel bad about themselves. The first is the sense of inadequacy that comes with being unable to fulfill the traditional role of being the provider for their family. This may lead to a loss in admiration and respect from their spouse or partner that can chip away at one’s self esteem. 
In some cases, women have been openly disrespectful towards a man who is unable to fulfill core financial needs. This is undoubtedly a contributor to high divorce rates. A lack of financial stability can furthermore cause single men to not even want to engage in the dating process. The dating scene often involves the man having to pick up the tab for expensive meals and entertainment activities. 
There is a mask of false bravado that many men wear. Underneath the mask, they are hurting because they haven’t figured out a way to live up to an ever illusive standard set by a hyper-materialistic American society. The standard is not one set amount of financial accumulation, but an ever changing goal line that seems to always be just out of reach. 
There is also the specter of social media that often causes people to act like they are in a financial position that is not in alignment with their reality. The point when the reality sets in that they are not the “baller” that they portray on social media can potentially create an impostor syndrome that can lead to deeper levels of depression. 
The realities of the labor market cannot be ignored. Black men have almost been rendered as obsolete in some areas of employment. Many of the traditional factory jobs that Black men once occupied have disappeared due to a myriad of factors, including globalization, automation, and competition from immigrant groups. A significant number of people have taken to self-medicating themselves with drugs and alcohol to cope with their frustration and disappointment. 
Rural areas that are predominately White are now being hit with the consequences of economic deterioration that has impacted inner cities for decades. The stress of being unable to adequately meet financial obligations has the capacity to press almost anyone into destructive behaviors. There has been a good deal written about the heroin and opioid crisis in various regions of the country. It has been hypothesized that a sizable portion of the crisis can be attributed to undiagnosed depression. 
The framing of the heroin and opioid crisis as a medical issue is drastically different from the crack epidemic that was characterized by criminality. It is also problematic that the Trump administration, through the directives of Attorney General Jeff Sessions wants to pump the gas on locking more people up for longer periods of time for drug offenses. There seems to be an effort to expend additional resources on incarceration while simultaneously cutting funding for public institutions and resources like public schools that produce economically viable citizens. 
Unfortunately, it looks like it may get worse before it gets better. The proposed Trump budget features draconian cuts for working class and poor people. An article from The Hill cited figures from the Washington Post that estimate that “Trump’s budget will include $800 billion in Medicaid cuts over the next 10 years, which would cause 10 million low-income people to lose health benefits.” 
Trump’s budget would also cut $193 billion from the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (Food Stamps). The impact of these cuts will be very significant for the African-American community. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported that “one in three food stamp households is headed by an African American. More than a third of food stamps benefits – over $10 billion per year – are issued to African Americans. 
Though the challenges are enormous, it is crucial for people to not be defeated by defeat at this time. We can’t afford to ignore the reality of what is going on, but we also can’t be overtaken by despair. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said that “only when it is dark enough can you see the stars.” 
We as a people have seen and conquered bigger obstacles. We must rise up and be more strategic with our actions, more targeted with our demands, and more steadfast in our resolve. We must simultaneously engage in an inside fight against hopelessness and an outside battle against forces that consistently block access and opportunity. Recognize the greatness that is within you and use it to help turn your broken dreams into a greater tomorrow for our communities.

Allison Fox,"The Candid, Honest Reasons These Women Called Off Their Engagements","The Candid, Honest Reasons These Women Called Off Their Engagements ""In my defense, the sex was really good."" By Allison Fox 
K.J., a single mom , had been in a relationship with Ben for three years before deciding that enough was enough: He didn’t seem to want to move in together, let alone get married . 
“With a broken heart, I went to break it off with him, and in a panic, he asked me to marry him,” she told HuffPost. “Our engagement was more stressful than ecstatic.” 
In the end, the engagement didn’t pan out. But she’s not alone; many women and men call off relationships with people they they seriously considered marrying. 
A common reason is fear of commitment, according to Elisabeth LaMotte , a couples’ psychotherapist and founder of the DC Counseling and Psychotherapy Center in Washington, D.C. 
“Fear of commitment can either be consciously or unconsciously hesitating to take a healthy relationship to the next level because you’re not ready, because you have something to work out in your own life,” LaMotte told HuffPost. “What also could be fear of commitment is a pattern of choosing either unavailable or unsuitable partners, so that as you get closer to committing, it’s clear that it’s just not going to work.” 
We asked women who read HuffPost if they’ve ever ended an engagement. Read what they had to say ― and the reasons they called off the relationships ― below. 1. I was succumbing to my family’s wishes instead of what I wanted. 
“When I was a senior in high school, I dated the son of a very prominent member of our church. Both of our families were emotionally invested in our relationship and pushed for an engagement. So naturally, we followed through with their wishes. 
I was pretty involved in my school choir and musical theater program. During the production, I became very close to the actor that portrayed my husband. It was our chemistry, the decision that I was much too young to be engaged to anyone and my separation from the church that led me to break the engagement.” ― E. Holloway 2. He developed a substance abuse problem. txking via Getty Images A pill addiction prompted R.S. to call off her engagement. 
“I was engaged when I was 19 years old after dating a guy for six months. About a month after we got engaged, his surgery for a serious medical issue caused him to develop a pill addiction. I watched his attitude and behavior change and decided to call the engagement off three months later. 
About a year after our break up, we reconnected and I decided to give him another chance. We dated for another three months before I broke up with him again, and I have never looked back. 
I am 25 years old now. I am so glad I called off that engagement and didn’t end up marrying him. That relationship was quite the learning experience for me. It taught me more about myself and what I’m willing to put up with and what I’m not.” ― R.S 3. He was financially irresponsible and immature. 
“I came home one night and my fiancé had bought an excavator. I didn’t have a problem with the machinery ― he was a contractor. 
But the problem was that he was using it to dig out a hole in our newly purchased backyard. Inside the hole there was a refrigerator, on fire . I didn’t know that large kitchen appliances burned. 
I just couldn’t stay with a man whose Friday night entertainment was roasting a perfectly good appliance while his friends hooted and hollered. Yes, the police showed up. He told them it ‘accidentally’ fell in and caught on fire. I moved back to D.C. and married another man. 
In my defense, the sex was really good. Not-appliance-burning-in-your-waterfront-backyard-good, but, good. ”― Lauren M. 4. I met another woman. Peopleimages via Getty Images Annie K. met another woman on Tumblr, and the relationship escalated. 
“I proposed to my girlfriend of three years on a trip to Ireland. We had been living together for about two years at that point and went months without having sex. I guess I thought being engaged would change things. We were pretty much glorified roommates. 
After a few months I started talking to a woman from Tumblr. She lived in another state but things escalated quickly. I’d talk to her on the phone and lie to my fiancée. I didn’t feel good about it. 
Eventually my fiancée became suspicious and confronted me about it, and we broke up. I also quickly ended things with the other woman, knowing I was not in a good place. I stayed single for a while but now I’m with the most amazing woman. Our relationship is polyamorous, which is also something I learned I needed to pursue.” ― Annie K. 5. The relationship was abusive. 
“I spent over six years with my ex. We lived together, he bought a ring, our families were intertwined and we had a dog. One day, in counseling, I was reflecting on my life and our relationship, and the progression of abuse I suffered was just staring me in the face. I realized that it was escalating with every day that passed. I knew I wouldn’t want a friend or my sister in a relationship like this, so why was I in it? I felt paralyzed and trapped and like I couldn’t leave. 
Then I got hired for a temporary job that lasted four months and allowed me to sail around the world ― literally circumventing the globe. He was planning on going with me but, honestly, the thought of sharing a tiny cabin with him, being in the middle of the ocean... I really believed in that moment that if he came with me, there was a good chance I wouldn’t come back. So I took his name off the itinerary and kicked him out of the apartment. A month later I left on the voyage that I believe literally saved my life.” ― Nicole L. 6. I met another man. Maria D. The engagement ring passed down from Maria D.'s grandmother. 
“We met in graduate school and dated for three years. We started to save for a home and received permission to use my grandmother’s heirloom wedding and engagement rings. 
I never second guessed that he was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, until that March when I met someone by a chance encounter. I had literally grabbed my coat and had my hand on the door to leave an event when he ran up to me. 
I never did date the man I met by chance, but meeting him was like one of those corny rom-com scenes where they look at each other and the rest of the room seems to fade away. It was a short amount of time before I realized that while [the new guy] wasn’t the perfect man for me or ‘The One,’ he was significantly closer to my perfect match than who I was with. Sometimes it just takes one small moment in time, as small as someone catching you at the door, to completely realign your life.” ― Maria D. 7. He couldn’t commit. 
“I had just turned 30 years old; Ben was 40. Although we had been in a relationship for over three years, he wasn’t showing signs of wanting to move in together, let alone propose. With a broken heart, I went to break it off with him, and in a panic, he asked me to marry him. 
Our engagement was more stressful than ecstatic. The plan was to put my parents’ diamond in a new setting, and he stalled on it. 
We were also in the process of buying a house. Time was of the essence; I had already sold the house I lived in with my kids. But much to my embarrassment, Ben didn’t show up for the appointment to sign the papers to make the home officially ours. Later, he said he was sleeping. It was the middle of the day. 
Ben made another appointment to sign. The morning of the new appointment, I called him and said I would be busy that day looking for a different house, this one just for me and the kids. 
To this day, ten years later , he has still never married. But I’m happily married to my best friend David ― also a single parent ― who I met just a few months after calling off the engagement.” ― K.J.

Matthew Jacobs,"Ranking 93 ‘Star Wars’ Characters (Yes, Even Horrible Jar Jar Binks)","Ranking 93 ‘Star Wars’ Characters (Yes, Even Horrible Jar Jar Binks) Our updated list now includes ""The Force Awakens"" and ""Rogue One."" By Matthew Jacobs , Andy McDonald , Bill Bradley Disney 
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, editors at HuffPost got together to rank characters in the “ Star Wars ” universe, from Jar Jar Binks to best. Now, in honor of the franchise’s 40th anniversary, we’re doing it again. Some of those editors have moved on from HuffPost and are now Force Ghosts, but with new additions from “The Force Awakens” and “Rogue One,” updated, the list must be. 
This subjective inventory weighed a number of factors — cultural imprint, importance to the story, coolness and whether or not the characters were toys we wanted to own right now as children. Longevity was also taken into account. Some newer characters were excluded but perhaps would be included in future updates as their impact and relevance grows. 
With this list, you’ll disagree. In the comments, let us know. And may the Force be with you. Always. 
93. Jar Jar Binks (pictured) 
92. Saw Gerrera 
90. Greedo (who shot first) 
89. Nute Gunray 
84. Characters from the chess board on the Millennium Falcon 
83 . Daniel Craig’s Stormtrooper 
82 . Supreme Leader Snoke 
81. All power-converter salesmen at Tosche Station 
80. Sebulba (pictured) 
79. Oola, Jabba’s dancer 
78. Malakili, rancor keeper 
40. All the Ewoks except Wicket 
39. Salacious B. Crumb 
30. Greedo (who didn’t shoot first) 
29. All the Tusken Raiders 
28. Padmé Amidala (pictured) 
And now, citizens of the universe, here are the top 20 you’re looking for: 
20. BB-8 
Much like C-3PO and R2D2 become the narrative conduit in the original trilogy, BB-8 fills that role in “The Force Awakens.” BB-8 represents that wide-eyed little kid we all tried to re-suppress after the disappointing prequels, who couldn’t help but emerge again in the presence of a resurrected — read: potentially better — “Star Wars” franchise. As hardened “Star Wars” fans, scarred by the saccharine CG-quels, resisting new episodes was understandable. But the second BB-8 let out that sad womp-womp-womp in the desert, convincing Rey to help him, he made it a “Star Wars” film. ― Andy McDonald 19. Grand Moff Tarkin 
YouTube 
It takes a special kind of Moff to hold Darth Vader’s leash. It takes Grand Moff Tarkin. Entrusted with the keys to the first Death Star by Emperor Palpatine, this high-ranking Imperial official was the man who destroyed Alderaan and nearly wiped out the Rebel Alliance at the Battle of Yavin. Unfortunately for the Empire and himself, Luke Skywalker’s X-wing slipped through his fingers as he tightened his grip on the uprising. — Chris Greenberg 18. Kylo Ren 
Darth Vader left behind a big cape to fill. And then along came his grandson, the testy and conflicted Kylo Ren. Once a Jedi in training who now wields a frightening crossguard lightsaber, Kylo takes no prisoners, including his own father, Han Solo. Leading a merry band of baddies and unmasking himself with an aplomb that Granddaddy Darth would never dare, Kylo Ren lacks the slick perfection of most “Star Wars” villains. He’s reckless, irascible, sloppy and all the more intimidating for it. His anger is enough to make his own Stormtroopers turn the other way, creating a dynamism that most franchise antagonists don’t capture. He can also deliver a withering insult, as evidenced when he hissed “look how old you’ve become” at Lor San Tekka. With Luke Skywalker re-emerging and Kylo’s conflict with Rey continuing to develop, the Kylo Ren Show is only just starting. ― Matthew Jacobs 17. Luke Skywalker 
Luke is the ostensible everyman of the “Star Wars” universe, the unwitting hero thrust into the middle of a galactic battle that raged long before he was even born. So why is he so annoying? In “A New Hope” and “The Empire Strikes Back,” Luke is such a teen he might as well stomp up the stairs and slam the door to his bedroom. In “Return of the Jedi,” his demeanor becomes equal parts smug and cocky, like a college freshman returning to his parents’ house for winter break. It’s all too much. (Meanwhile, Han and Leia are carrying the heavy water for the Rebel Alliance.) Fans might find this controversial, but search your feelings ― you know it to be true. — Christopher Rosen 16. Jabba the Hutt 
Jabba’s only notable appearance in the franchise comes in “Return of the Jedi” (sorry, Special Edition Jabba in “A New Hope”), but his Tatooine lair is such a world unto its own that the crime lord has remained one of the franchise’s defining figures. The many creatures who inhabit his cave have become just as much a part of his image as their own, from Bib Fortuna and the green slave woman to a band that rivals the Mos Eisley cantina group. Jabba may be a massive blob, but his spittle has earned its spot in the “Star Wars” canon. — MJ 15. Emperor Palpatine 
With the ability to deceive and maintain control over most of the galaxy, Emperor Palpatine was arguably the most powerful character in the “Star Wars” universe. But like many villains, his downfall was the result of his overconfidence and pride. He incorrectly believed that he had enslaved Darth Vader to the point of no return. But while the Emperor was the worst of the worst, he was also ... kind of fun? Sometimes you just want to obscure your face in your hoodie and let out an twisted, raspy, “Greetings, young Skywalker!” — AM 14. Admiral Ackbar 
If you believe Admiral Ackbar’s significance lies solely in his leading the attack on the second Death Star, stop that line of thinking — IT’S A ... pitfall. Part of what makes Ackbar so meaningful to “Star Wars” is that he is one of the highest-ranking military figures in the Rebel Alliance (Supreme Commander) and a non-human. Ackbar’s existence represents precisely the progressive values held by the rebellion in its battle against a Galactic Empire known for its hostility toward non-humans. OK, yes, fine: IT’S A TRAP! — AM 13. Rey 
She’s a hero who needs only one name, like Chewbacca or Madonna. But if she had a surname, what would it be? Skywalker? Kenobi? Last name Ever, first name Greatest? Rey’s mysterious past and crazy connection to The Force make her one of the most intriguing characters in the “Star Wars” universe. And she’s a baller. Whenever this orphan-somehow-turned-expert-pilot is on screen, it’s worth all the portions Unkar Plutt could give. All of them! If we had known Rey a little longer, she’d most definitely break the top 10. She is the last Jedi, after all. Wait, isn’t she? Is “Last Jedi” plural? Seriously, who are her parents? Is it Jar Jar? Rey, meesa thinks yousa owe us some answers. ― Bill Bradley 12. C-3PO 
In terms of pure comedic relief, there is no better member of the “Star Wars” ensemble than C-3PO. Fluent in “over 6 million forms of communication,” Threepio is one-half of the best dysfunctional multilingual duo in movie history (alongside R2-D2, of course). The gold droid with the heart of a puppy dog and the temperament of an anxious worrywart is vital in getting the Rebels off Hoth and Han out of Jabba the Hutt’s palace. He may be an Anakin Skywalker creation, but he’s more fun than any other “Star Wars” character. Just don’t call him a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! — MJ 11. Darth Maul 
There have been few greater collective nerdgasms than the moment when Darth Maul unleashed the second blade of his double-sided lightsaber. (Look at that thing.) Horn-headed, eyes fire-red with flips for days, Maul is a demon’s whisper who slinks in and out of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan’s peripherals before their epic final confrontation. Basically a manifestation of pure evil, the Sith Lord’s brief but insidious film stint was so haunting, his image has reached further than just the “Star Wars” universe. — Ryan Kristobak 10. Lando Calrissian 
Hello, what have we here ? Lando Calrissian, of course. The true rapscallion of the “Star Wars” universe, Lando was a classic anti-hero in “The Empire Strikes Back.” Full redemption came later in “Return of the Jedi,” but the real reason he’s listed here is because of the way he says “Han” and “Chewbacca.” — CR 9. Qui-Gon Jinn 
When the Jedi High Council hands down a decision, the Jedi Order listens without question. Everyone, that is, except for Qui-Gon Jinn. An O.G. Jedi badass, Qui-Gon asked the difficult questions while simultaneously showing love for even the smallest and seemingly most insignificant beings (seriously, he even liked Jar-Jar). Outside his many words of wisdom, we have Jinn to thank for discovering the Chosen One. — RK 8. Chewbacca 
Is there a more lovable, oversized fuzzball than Chewbacca? If only we all had a sidekick as loyal as Han Solo’s Wookiee, who’s committed to protecting him after Han is dismissed from the Imperial Navy for refusing to kill Chewie. (We just went expanded universe on you guys.) He’s more than just friendly devotion and animalistic wails, though. Chewbacca convinces Han to turn back when he wants to abandon the Rebels in “A New Hope,” and how would the Millennium Falcon’s hyperdrive functions cooperate without his handiwork? He saved Yoda in “Revenge of the Sith,” and he basically gets the final word (so to speak) in “A New Hope.” He may seem like a “walking carpet,” but The Force would fall apart without our old pal Chewie. — MJ 7. Yoda 
What to be said, need be? Yoda is one of the most recognizable characters in all of pop culture. He’s one of the wisest and most powerful of all the Jedi. A speech pattern named after him he has. In “Empire Strikes Back,” he’s introduced as a goofy little green muppet — with the soul of a philosopher. By “Return of the Jedi,” as you sadly watch Yoda fade away into “forever sleep,” you completely forget that he’s made of cloth and latex. That’s when you walk out of the room and tell your friends there’s “something in your eye.” — AM 6. R2-D2 
The case can be made that with a few bloops and bleeps, R2-D2 is the most charming member of the “Star Wars” universe. The extremely well put-together droid is sassy in a way that makes him endearing — he doesn’t put up with C-3PO’s antics, for instance, and displays no fear in the face of the evil Empire. He’s also loyal: look at how hard he works to find Obi-Wan in “Episode IV” as evidence. Speaking of which: Without R2-D2’s bravery, would the events of “A New Hope” even occur? If Princess Leia had given the Death Star plans to C-3PO, we’d all be wearing drab grey uniforms and worshiping at the feet of Darth Vader. Hero status: legit. — CR 5. Boba Fett 
It’s one thing to have a lot of great lines or amazing appearances in a film, but it’s quite another to have almost zero dialogue, just a handful of scenes, and still be seen as one of the most terrific characters in the entire series. But that’s Boba Fett. When even Darth Vader shows a modicum of respect for you, that’s saying something. And though the prequels killed his tough-guy image a bit — and the original trilogy, well, just killed him altogether, pre-expanded universe — Boba Fett is a character whose likeness is forever canonized. And not by George Lucas or some poorly conceived prequels, but by the fans. Like his Mandalorian armor, Fett’s legend is not easily compromised. — AM 4. Obi-Wan Kenobi 
From the first moment we see him as a Padawan to his days in recluse as Ben Kenobi, Obi-Wan’s resolve, patience and excellent lightsaber skills make him one of the most important Jedis to ever exist. Look at this resume: He was the first Jedi to defeat a Sith Lord in approximately 1,000 years, routing on Darth Maul when all hope seemed lost. He conquers Anakin in combat, and despite all of the egregious actions his former Padawan has undertaken ― younglings, guys, Anakin killed younglings ― Obi-Wan chooses not to end his pupil’s life because Obi-Wan’s love runs too deep for his friend. In the end, Obi-Wan sacrifices his life so Luke can become the Jedi he was destined to be. True, compassionate and genuinely good, Obi-Wan is what makes a man a man. — RK 3. Leia Organa 
Rebel. Politician. Soldier. Diplomat. Princess. Leia Organa is the woman that women want to be and that sibling Jedi and smugglers want to be with. From the moment her ship, Tantive IV, enters the screen carrying those stolen plans in “A New Hope,” this fearless and feisty heroine goes where most Galactic males feared to tread. Though she may look the part of the damsel, Leia doesn’t do distress, even when she’s in grave danger. She withstands Darth Vader’s torture on the first Death Star and gets fatal revenge on Jabba The Hutt for objectifying her with that metal bikini. A one-woman committee for change in the galaxy, Leia turns out to be Force-sensitive. — CG 2. Darth Vader 
The first time Darth Vader ever appeared onscreen, he was cloaked in a haze of white exhaust from a Stormtrooper shootout. As his black cape comes into view, everyone flees — and one of cinema’s most iconic villains is born. There may be no movie character more synonymous with a few bars of music than Darth Vader is with the Imperial March. Over the course of the original “Star Wars” trilogy (we’re not talking about Anakin Skywalker here), Darth Vader’s guttural voice and masked visage gave us many of the franchise’s most memorable quotes (“I find your lack of faith disturbing”) and introduced the most terrifying way to die in screen history. Vader ranks behind only Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates on AFI’s list of the greatest movie villains of all time, but surely neither of the other two has sold more than his body weight in toys and memorabilia. Impressive. Most impressive. — MJ 1. Han Solo 
Mamas, don’t let your babies grow up to be smugglers. Don’t let ‘em fire blasters and drive that old Millennium Falcon. Make ‘em be Jedi and Imperial Governors and such. Unless, of course, you want them to be like Han Solo. A scoundrel with a heart of gold, Solo is the dashing, world(s)-weary cynic who shoots first and fixes the hyperdrive later. He may have joined up with the Rebellion for the paycheck and not the ideals, but that doesn’t stop him from helping to destroy a few Death Stars along the way. Don’t worry, he knows you love him. — CG ALSO ON HUFFPOST:",english,,,,,"— christopher rosen , jedi , luke skywalker , rey , luke skywalker  luke , boba fett , norman bates , padmé amidala , darth maul , skywalker , darth vader , malakili , leia organa , anakin skywalker , huffpost , leia , lando , palpatine , yoda , andy mcdonald , ackbar , sebulba , matthew jacobs , daniel craig , chris greenberg , granddaddy darth , lando calrissian , ben kenobi , leia organa  rebel , yavin , luke , bill bradley disney , obi-wan , greedo , snoke , george lucas , kylo ren , kylo , han , bill bradley , kylo ren  darth vader , madonna , hoth , anakin , kenobi , salacious b. crumb , nute gunray , — ryan kristobak , ","padawan , lor san tekka , galactic empire , tosche station  80 , darth vader , ",,,,"kylo ren show , qui-gon , jedi high council , afi , force , o.g. jedi , supreme commander , hutt  jabba , mos eisley , rebel alliance , darth vader , oola , tusken raiders , bib fortuna , huffpost , imperial navy , death star , millennium falcon , imperial , mj , ",http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOibwTZdnAMsCVdFNLOBqf_MR73L5YiXV5ie6R8OcVyMHt.nbYz6FwfbySLvN835wAfMF_zjvedDu5c.FkVs_Ru3,"Ranking 93 ‘Star Wars’ Characters (Yes, Even Horrible Jar Jar Binks)",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/verticals/entertainment/news.xml,Entertainment News on The Huffington Post,2017-05-26T01:36:00.000+03:00,0,1,news,huffingtonpost.com,US,http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/1910_1000/592702f62000003a0016edca.jpeg?cache=5gmorz2kb2,1,
Igor Bobic,Progressives In Congress Call For $2 Trillion In Infrastructure Spending | HuffPost,"Progressives In Congress Call For $2 Trillion In Infrastructure Spending “This is how we take our country back. This is how we do job creation."" By Igor Bobic 
WASHINGTON ― Progressive members of Congress on Thursday unveiled their own plan to overhaul the nation’s crumbling roads, bridges and waterways ― an ambitious proposal that dwarfs plans offered both by President Donald Trump and Senate Democrats . 
The so-called “21st Century New Deal for Jobs” invests $2 trillion over the next 10 years to make badly needed repairs to the nation’s transportation, water, energy and information systems. It contains several progressive priorities, including the use of Davis-Bacon prevailing wage standards, maintenance of racial and gender equity in hiring, focus on low-income communities and carbon-free energy production. 
Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), who spearheaded the effort, said the plan would employ 2.5 million Americans in its first year. 
“This is how we take our country back. This is how we do job creation,” he said at a press conference organized by the Congressional Progressive Caucus on Capitol Hill. 
Unlike Trump’s $1 trillion infrastructure plan, which prioritizes tax incentives to fund infrastructure projects by a 5-1 margin, the progressive initiative relies directly on public investment. The CPC says it would be paid by the closing of unspecified corporate tax loopholes, a new tax on Wall Street transactions, and by repatriating funds held by U.S. companies overseas. 
While Trump has yet to release his promised infrastructure plan, its broad outlines look very different from the wish list offered by progressives. The president’s proposal is said to include only $200 billion in public spending. The remainder of the initiative is said to rely on private tax incentives meant to spur investment in infrastructure projects. Such funding mechanisms, known as public-private partnerships, often involve privately financed toll roads. 
Deficit-averse Republicans in Congress are unlikely to consider a big spending proposal. The progressive infrastructure effort, rather, attempts to offer a clear contrast between Democratic and Republican policies ahead of the 2018 midterm election. 
“President Trump has suggested that he will address the infrastructure gap. His ideas, however, are insufficient. They are riddled with fancy and unnecessary gimmicks, and laced with tax breaks for his wealthy friends,” the CPC says. “We cannot afford to accept a plan like this that helps Wall Street investors, but leaves ordinary Americans behind.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Julia Brucculieri,Watch Celine Dion Perform The New ‘Beauty And The Beast’ Song For The First Time | HuffPost,"Watch Celine Dion Perform The New ‘Beauty And The Beast’ Song For The First Time It's magical. By Julia Brucculieri 
Celine Dion gave the crowd at Las Vegas’ The Colosseum at Caesars Palace quite the magical gift on Wednesday night. 
Canada’s national treasure performed “How Does a Moment Last Forever,” one of the new songs from Disney’s live-action remake of “ Beauty and the Beast .” The performance marked the first time Dion sang the song live, and it was worth the wait. The song played through the end credits in the remake, though Kevin Kline’s Maurice sings it in the film. 
The 49-year-old, who seems to be in the middle of a career renaissance of sorts, began by telling the crowd she was “very nervous and very excited at the same time” to sing the song. 
“I was very fortunate to be a part of that magical movie, ‘Beauty and the Beast.’ And it was one of the biggest moments of my show business career,” she said, adding that she was “so thankful” for the opportunity. 
Dion’s connection to the Disney classic goes back 26 years, when she sang the title track (with Peabo Bryson) for the 1991 animated movie’s soundtrack. The song, which the chanteuse credits with putting her “on the map,” won an Academy Award. 
Check out her entire performance of “How Does a Moment Last Forever” in the video above, and relive the magic of the original title track, below: ALSO ON HUFFPOST Celine Dion Through The Years Celine Dion Through The Years Celine Dion Through The Years 1 of 53 CANADA - APRIL 01: Retro Celine Dion (file pictures) In Canada In April 1998-Canadian singer Celine Dion (file pictures).

Zahara Hill,Single Dad Hosts Class For Men To Learn To Do Their Daughters' Hair,"Single Dad Hosts Class For Men To Learn To Do Their Daughters' Hair The dad is sharing his knowledge with fellow fathers. By Zahara Hill 
When Darious Bland became a single father seven years ago, he was at a loss as to how to go about doing his daughter’s hair. He’s since picked up a few tricks, and now the Alabama native is sharing them with his fellow dads. 
On May 21, Bland held a hair workshop titled “Can Daddy Do My Hair?” in Hunstsville, AL. 
The event allowed 12 dads to come with their 3- to 10-year-old daughters as Bland guided them in navigating the understated difficulty of styling black hair. 
“These dads are learning a lot; not only about hair but what many moms go through,” he told WHNT . “They didn’t understand the frustration that mothers have to go through while doing their daughters’ hair.” 
Videos of fathers doing their daughters’ hair have made their rounds on the internet throughout the years. And an April BBC News video showed health and well-being guru Khembe Clarke hosting a similar event for black fathers in England. 
As for Bland, he admits he still has a thing or two to learn. 
“I’m learning how to do flat twists, bantu knots, I want to learn how to braid,” he said. 
For those who couldn’t make the workshop, Bland also posts video tutorials on the event’s Facebook page.

Allison Fox,The 7 Injuries Doctors See Most On Summer Weekends,"The 7 Injuries Doctors See Most On Summer Weekends Stay safe out there. By Allison Fox Thomas Barwick via Getty Images 
Warm weather and longer days will bring many Americans outdoors for cookouts, pool parties and more. But long weekends ― we’re looking at you, Memorial Day ― also lead to more trips to urgent care or even the emergency room, according to experts. In fact, a 2015 study from researchers at Brown University found that heat-related illness alone can ratchet emergency department visits in the summertime. 
The risk for issues like drowning and sports injuries go up in the hotter seasons, according to Dr. Christopher M. McStay, chief of clinical operations and associate professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. And they’re usually all preventable. 
We asked doctors to explain the most common reasons why patients end up in their offices during summer months ― and what can be done to prevent you or a loved one from being among them. 1. Heat-related illness. 
During summer months, people often show up at the doctor with a heat-related condition, from mild dehydration to severe heatstroke, says Dawne Kort, an emergency medicine doctor and attending physician at CityMD Urgent Care Walk-In Medical Clinic. 
Fewer than 1,000 Americans die each year due to heat-related illness, according to a 2014 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But plenty more experience the more mild symptoms of too much sun exposure, which include nausea, dizziness, headaches and confusion. 
“Be mindful of the temperature, stay hydrated and avoid being outside for prolonged periods of time if the temperature is high ― especially during the hottest time of the day ,” Kort told HuffPost, noting that the warmest hours are usually between 2 and 4 p.m. wundervisuals via Getty Images Doctors see an uptick in drowning incidents and water activity accidents in warmer months. 2. Swimming injuries and drowning. 
Memorial Day weekend is the first time many people will head out for water-related activities. 
“We see a fair amount of swimming-related [injuries],” McStay told HuffPost. “Trauma related to jumping into a body of water, small children who are not being supervised, boating injuries.” 
Joseph Perno, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida, says these water-related dangers definitely increase when the weather gets warm. 
“We see a big spike in drowning,” Perno told HuffPost. “When you have a lot of adults together, you’d think there would be more people watching the kids but what happens is people are distracted: Talking, drinking, partying, having fun and no one is watching the kids.” 
Drowning is the second most common cause of death by unintentional injury, behind car accidents, among children ages 1-4 years-old, according to the U.S. Centers For Disease Control And Prevention. Children are also more likely to drown in a swimming pool than anywhere else. 
It’s so easy for a child to fall into water without someone realizing, Perno says. If you’re having a pool party, rotate having a designated adult to supervise water activities, he suggests. 3. Burns and cuts. 
There are numerous hospital visits for burns associated with grilling and camp fires, as well as cuts from kitchen knives, according to McStay. 
Children may try to touch the fires and adults make the common mistake of squirting lighter fluid onto hot coals. Be safe about it: Apply lighter fluid to coals when they aren’t lit, letting the fluid soak in, McStay suggests. Hero Images via Getty Images Back away from the coleslaw that's been sitting in the sun for hours on end. 4. Food poisoning and gastroenteritis. 
Gastrointestinal issues frequently bring people to the emergency room during warmer months, according to Kort. In fact, food-borne illnesses peak in the summer months, since hot temperatures and humid conditions provide the optimum breeding ground for bacteria to multiply rapidly, according to the U.S Department of Agriculture. 
“[It’s] commonly seen after a summer barbecue, where the food has not been properly cooked or may have been left out in the heat. Or when fruits and vegetables have not been washed properly,” Kort said. 
Be especially wary of food that’s been sitting out in the sun all day and wash your hands properly before eating, Kort advises. 5. Sports injuries 
Sports-related injuries from playing frisbee, football and outdoor activities are also a bigger issue. Sprained wrists, twisted ankles and broken bones are common sights in urgent care clinics and emergency rooms between spring and summer, according to the experts. 
Treatment for these injuries typically requires a little home care, Kort said. Rest the body, ice the injury, compress the body part and elevate the injured area. But if something feels seriously wrong or keeps getting worse, head to the doctor as soon as possible. Imgorthand via Getty Images Ticks and bug bites: 'Tis the season! 6. Skin irritations and insect bites. 
With long days spent outdoors, it’s common to see irritations from wild plants like poison ivy, sumac and oak. Insect and tick bites are also common and, in some cases of infection, may require an antibiotic, Kort said. 
This year, in particular, may bring with it more tick bites and tick-borne diseases than previous summers. And Zika virus, though currently out of the news cycle, may be poised to come back in some states . 
Keep an eye on any bumps or swelling that does not go away or grows in size. And learn some expert-backed tips to keep yourself safe from ticks and mosquitoes . 7. Sunburns. 
While most sunburns don’t require a trip to the hospital, some do. In 2013, there were nearly 34,000 emergency room visits in the U.S. due to serious sunburns, according to recent research in Dermatology. Go to the doctor if your sunburn results in blistering or is accompanied by nausea, confusion, headache, extreme pain or chills. You should also head to the doctor if at-home remedies such as applying aloe vera or taking a pain reliever like ibuprofen does not help after a couple of days. 
But even if you can take care of your burn at home, it’s an uncomfortable mishap that’s easy to avoid. 
Practice good sun protection habits for yourself and especially watch out for children you’re supervising, since they are unlikely to remember to reapply lotion. 
“Having a sunburn is uncomfortable and painful,” McStay said. “And the chronic risk of sun exposure and skin cancer is something to think about everyday.” 
So walk into the long, warm weekend a bit more alert. Better to be safe than sorry.

Jenavieve Hatch,Grown Men Upset By Movie Theater Offering Women-Only Screening Of 'Wonder Woman',"05/25/2017 02:07 pm ET | Updated 11 hours ago Grown Men Upset By Movie Theater Offering Women-Only Screening Of 'Wonder Woman' You OK, guys? By Jenavieve Hatch Warner Bros 
An Austin-based movie theater has angered men for offering a women-only screening of the upcoming “Wonder Woman” film. 
In a Facebook post Wednesday, the movie theater announced the special screening, with a link back to an innocent and enthusiastic post about the event on its website. 
“The most iconic superheroine in comic book history finally has her own movie, and what better way to celebrate than with an all-female screening?” the announcement reads. “Apologies, gentlemen, but we’re embracing our girl power and saying ‘No Guys Allowed’ for one special night at the Alamo Ritz.” 
Like clockwork, angry men of the internet responded by calling the theater sexist for hosting a women-only screening of a movie that’s empowering for women. 
One man commented , “ Apparently ‘equality’ is only selective nowadays ... How about a ‘men’s only’ showing of a movie or is that not how equality works?” A nother offended gentleman said that it was “wrong,” and that he will “never set foot in [the] theater again.” 
Check out some of the comments below. Facebook 
And regardless of the fact that the theater is hosting dozens of other screenings for the film, some men on Twitter were also quick to take offense. Twitter Twitter Twitter 
Alamo responded to many of the commenters , even the angry ones, encouraging them to think twice about why this might be an exciting event for many women: 
We hate to lose your business, and it’s certainly your right to campaign against us. Humor us ― give it a day or so and consider this notion (it’s true, we promise): that the event is really just supposed to be a fun way for female fans of a comic book character that’s important to them symbolically to see a movie they’re excited about. There’s no political agenda intended, honest. 
Another Twitter user pointed out that the men’s complaints were futile ― the original women-only screening has apparently already sold out, prompting the theater to add more shows. We've added a 2nd screening of our WOMEN ONLY: WONDER WOMAN show here in Austin. Tickets are live now: https://t.co/P00kgkOogv pic.twitter.com/GGlzacIvmx — Alamo Drafthouse ATX (@drafthouse) May 25, 2017 
In a statement to HuffPost, Alamo representatives were enthusiastic about the screening and inspired by the “wrath of trolls” to continue providing an exciting experience for women ― and Alamo now plans on expanding the women-only screening options in its theaters nationwide. 
“We are very excited to present select, women-only Wonder Woman screenings at Alamo Drafthouse,” said Morgan Hendrix, Alamo Drafthouse creative manager, in the statement. “That providing an experience where women truly reign supreme has incurred the wrath of trolls only serves to deepen our belief that we’re doing something right. As a result, we will be expanding this program across the country and inviting women everywhere to join us as we celebrate this iconic superheroine in our theaters.” 
Representatives for Alamo also told HuffPost that proceeds from the ticket sales for their D.C., Austin and Dallas screenings will be donated to local women’s charities.",english,,,,,"morgan hendrix , ","alamo ritz , alamo drafthouse , d.c. , austin , dallas , alamo , ",,,,"jenavieve hatch warner bros , twitter twitter twitter  alamo , facebook , ",http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOhtbiApETda4i__4kJa.Ygrfa4XdIWnfmqnSZZJLOq32JBYteHoqFqCJJR0HWJQvWXWRCZpb1dCW66WfQCVNDfTj8kxh9fm21deEN3GGb2qUJ.gSk0h7ozfjK8vdSmZgtanbwPQJdfnBSCh_sYfUeA9,Grown Men Upset By Movie Theater Offering Women-Only Screening Of 'Wonder Woman',http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/news.xml,The Huffington Post | Full News Feed,2017-05-26T02:07:00.000+03:00,0,1,news,huffingtonpost.com,US,http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/1910_1000/592702bc2000003200cb2a53.png?cache=leilpa3gi8,0,
Daniel Marans,A Majority Of Senate Democrats Support Bernie Sanders' $15 Minimum Wage Bill,"05/25/2017 02:05 pm ET | Updated May 25, 2017 A Majority Of Senate Democrats Support Bernie Sanders' $15 Minimum Wage Bill Last time, just five of Sanders' colleagues were on board. By Daniel Marans 
A majority of the Senate Democratic caucus is backing a bill that would raise the federal minimum wage to $15 just two years after a comparable bill introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) received scant support from his colleagues. 
Thirty of Sanders’ colleagues in the caucus joined the former presidential candidate in formally introducing the bill on Thursday, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), ranking member on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. By contrast, just five senators co-sponsored Sanders’ 2015 bill raising the minimum wage to $15. 
Schumer and Murray announced their support for the bill at an April press conference. At the time, however, the bill enjoyed the support of 23 other senators ― just shy of a majority of the Democratic caucus. 
“The time is long overdue for us to raise the minimum wage, which is now, at the federal level, $7.25 an hour, which I think under any definition is a starvation wage,” Sanders said at a Thursday press conference on the bill’s introduction. 
“We have got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage,” he said. “And what we are here to say is that living wage is $15 an hour.” Mark Wilson/Getty Images Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) is ""feeling the bern"" when it comes to the $15 minimum wage. 
Sanders was flanked by Senate and House co-sponsors, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), as well as low-wage federal contract workers from Good Jobs Nation, an offshoot of the labor union-backed “Fight for $15” campaign. Reps. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Bobby Scott (D-Va.), the ranking member on the House Education and Workforce Committee, are introducing an identical companion bill in the House. The bill currently has 153 co-sponsors, a large majority of the House Democratic caucus. 
Sanders was able to attract the support of party leaders and other more moderate colleagues by extending the phase-in period from 2020 to 2024, assuaging fears that a rapid increase would result in job losses. The largest hike in pay would occur right away if enacted, with the law lifting the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $9.25 this July. 
The federal minimum wage has not gone up since 2009, when former President George W. Bush approved the last of several gradual increases. 
But after the Service Employees International Union launched the “Fight for $15” movement in 2012, a growing number of cities and states have adopted the $15 minimum, making it a major benchmark for progressive activists. Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and the state of New York are all in the process of raising their minimum wages to $15. 
Of course, with Republicans controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress, there is virtually no chance that this legislation will be considered, let alone pass. Democrats are instead using the bill to show the public what they would do if they had power, with a particular eye on their restless progressive base, which would like to see the party embrace Sanders-style economic populism.

Claire Fallon,"Everything Is Exhausting Right Now, And Merriam-Webster Has The Perfect Word For Us","Everything Is Exhausting Right Now, And Merriam-Webster Has The Perfect Word For Us Inanition, the word that sums up everything about politics right now. By Claire Fallon Getty / Twitter 
For reasons of its own, the feisty dictionary Merriam-Webster decided to feature “inanition” as its word of the day on May 25, 2017. 
The noun describes “an exhausted condition,” more specifically “the exhausted condition that results from lack of food and water” or, secondarily, “the absence or loss of social, moral, or intellectual vitality or vigor.” Today's #WordOfTheDay is 'inanition.' Remember to stay hydrated. https://t.co/R8mN3mhMkm pic.twitter.com/pHss84VJWM 
Thanks to the online dictionary’s justified reputation as a sly political commentator and watchdog , followers were quick to see shade cast by the selection: @MerriamWebster MerriamWebster throwing so much shade I threw away my sunscreen — TNR Kitty (@TNRKITTY) May 25, 2017 @MerriamWebster So another way to say this would be ""low energy"", right? — Noah Neidlinger (@candor_for_sale) May 25, 2017 
Others made more direct political connections: @mea_mark @MerriamWebster I drink a lot of ice water. Given the rollback on the #EPA and clean air/water act .... this may become difficult. I miss Obama. ?? — Iterators (@IteratorsLLC) May 25, 2017 
Who knows what motivated Merriam-Webster to highlight “inanition” at this moment in history Thursday? We can only speculate. 
There’s certainly no confirmation that this feature was meant to tweak President Donald Trump for his reported belief that exercise depletes the human body’s finite reservoir of energy ; or for the claim that his “Islamic terrorism” dogwhistle during a recent speech was a flub (”he’s just an exhausted guy,” a White House official told CNN ); or for his previous criticism of Hillary Clinton as “low energy,” a claim which now strikes many as hypocritical . 
The list of possible reasons goes on: Maybe the featured word was random. Maybe it was intended to serve as a reminder to hydrate during the upcoming warm summer months. 
Maybe it was a wink of solidarity to those who feel fatigued by the constant flood of scandalous leaks coming from the White House and the repeated attempts by the administration and Congress to gut healthcare programs, environmental protection measures and other federal programs that many rely on for health and survival. 
One thing we do know, however, is what “inanition” means. Thanks, Merriam-Webster!

Sam Levine,Democrats Launch New Effort To Fight Back Against Trump's Bogus Claims Of Voter Fraud,"Democrats Launch New Effort To Fight Back Against Trump's Bogus Claims Of Voter Fraud They say the president just wants to make it more difficult for people to vote. By Sam Levine 
Two weeks after President Donald Trump announced a commission to investigate illegal voting , Democrats are responding with a new effort to highlight voter suppression and debunk claims that voter fraud is a widespread problem. 
T he Democratic National Committee will run the Commission on Protecting American Democracy from the Trump Administration, which is setting out to examine efforts that made it more difficult to vote in 2016 and work toward improving access to the ballot box. 
Trump has said repeatedly that between 3 million and 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election, but hasn’t offered any evidence to support the claim. Voter fraud does exist, but several investigations have already found that it is not a widespread problem . Nonetheless, Trump convened a presidential commission led by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), who has pushed some of the toughest voting restrictions in the country, to investigate voter fraud. Critics were quick to argue that the commission was a pretext for justifying restrictions on voting. 
Former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander is set to lead the DNC’s effort. He is also the president of Let America Vote, a group that targets elected officials who make it more difficult to vote. “I would prefer that there not be a need for a commission to protect American democracy from the Trump administration. But there is,” he told HuffPost. “I think in general what you’ll see is us really mirroring and standing up against the actions of the commission.” 
In a statement, Kander accused Trump of trying to tweak the electoral system to his advantage. 
“Trump’s presidency has already been a disaster, and he knows that the only way he’s going to win again in 2020 is if he tips the scales in his favor,” he said. “His commission is meant to pave the way for restrictive laws that will allow Republicans to win elections. It’s wrong, it’s a danger to democracy and we’re not going to let it happen.” I would prefer that there not be a need for a commission to protect American democracy from the Trump administration. But there is. Former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander 
DNC Chairman Tom Perez called Trump’s commission “nothing but a sham to justify the GOP’s voter suppression efforts across the country.” 
“Instead of listening to constituents and working to earn their votes, Republicans would rather deny them their constitutional rights at the ballot box,” he said in a statement. “Our commission will be ready to counter every move that the Trump administration makes to silence eligible voters.” 
The DNC effort will have four staffers to work with state officials and voting rights advocates to protect voting rights, according to The Nation . The DNC previously only had one full-time staffer focused on voting protection. 
The Democratic commission is also set to include: Rep. Terri Sewell (Ala.), who is set to be vice chair, Reps. Gwen Moore (Wis.), Joaquin Castro (Texas) and Grace Meng (N.Y.); Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.); Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes; California Secretary of State Alex Padilla; Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey; District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine; Colorado House Speaker Crisanta Duran; Louisiana State Senator Karen Carter Peterson; and Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes.

S.V. Dáte,Trump Uses NATO Unity Ceremony To Bash European Allies on Military Spending,"05/25/2017 01:44 pm ET | Updated 11 hours ago Trump Uses NATO Unity Ceremony To Bash European Allies On Military Spending “This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States,"" Trump said in Brussels. By S.V. Date 
BRUSSELS – President Donald Trump on Thursday publicly scolded European allies for taking advantage of U.S. taxpayers by failing to spend enough on defense ― while in private reportedly breaking with them over how to treat Russia, the country that worked to help get him elected. 
“NATO members must fully contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations,’’ he said at a ceremony intended to mark the alliance’s solidarity in responding to the 9/11 attacks on America. 
“Twenty-three of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they’re supposed to be paying for their defense,” Trump said. “This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States. And many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years.” 
Trump spoke at NATO’s sparkling new headquarters building at the dedication of a memorial to the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks ― the only time in the alliance’s 68-year history that it invoked the “Article 5” promise that an attack on one was the same as an attack on all has ever been invoked. 
Trump briefly acknowledged the military assistance NATO has provided in the war in Afghanistan, but spent more than a quarter of his eight-minute speech criticizing the alliance’s nations as several of their elected leaders stood by with uncomfortable looks on their faces. 
Trump said he has been “very, very direct’’ with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and alliance members in saying that the they “must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations.” 
“Over the past eight years, the United States spent more on defense than all other NATO countries combined,” he said. 
By referring to countries owing “massive amounts of money,” though, Trump incorrectly described the nature of the organization. NATO does collect relatively modest dues for the operation of its headquarters and other largely administrative functions. But the collective defense component comes through the member nations collecting taxes from their own citizens to pay for their own militaries, which then work together. 
The concept of “burden-sharing,” where other NATO members would increase their own defense spending, has been a U.S. priority long before Trump took office, and in fact became formalized in 2014. 
That year, following the declaration of a “caliphate” by the Islamic State terrorist group in Syria, immediately adjacent to NATO member Turkey, NATO agreed that each nation would ramp up its defense spending to 2 percent of its economy over the coming decade. 
Trump termed the 2 percent figure “insufficient to close he gaps in modernizing readiness and the size of forces.” 
During his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly criticized NATO and went so far as to suggest it could be dissolved as “obsolete” because the Cold War had ended ― a view aligned with Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s criticisms of the alliance through the years. 
Indeed, if Russia had hoped to drive a wedge between the U.S. and western Europe with its support of Trump’s candidacy, that strategy appears to be paying off. 
European Council President Donald Tusk told reporters after a private meeting with Trump earlier Thursday that Russia appears to be an issue that will divide the U.S. and its traditional European allies. 
“I’m not 100 percent sure we can say that we have a common position, a common opinion on Russia,” Tusk said, according to a report by the BBC . “Although when it comes to the conflict on Ukraine, we were on the same line.” 
In his remarks at the memorial dedication, Trump only in passing mentioned Russia. “The NATO of the future must include a great focus on terrorism and immigration as well as threats from Russia and on NATO’s eastern and southern borders,” he said. 
The bulk of the rest of his remarks focused on combatting Islamist terrorism. 
The White House’s three-paragraph readout of Trump’s meeting with Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the three discussed ISIS, North Korea and trade, but did not mention Russia. The White House press office did not immediately respond to a query regarding Tusk’s reported statements. 
U.S. intelligence services agree that their Russian counterparts covertly worked to harm the candidacy of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and to support Trump. Their tactics included stealing emails from Democrats and releasing embarrassing ones through WikiLeaks, the intelligence services have concluded. 
Trump denies he knew anything about the assistance or that he colluded with Russians during the campaign. He did, however, fire FBI Director James Comey and cited the FBI’s probe into Russian meddling as a reason. And Comey in an internal memo said that Trump during a private meeting asked him to drop the FBI’s investigation into the president’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, over his contacts with Russia. Flynn was forced to resign after less than a month in his post after he misled Vice President Mike Pence about those contacts. 
Trump is scheduled to meet with the most prominent of the NATO allies he just criticized at Friday and Saturday’s meeting in Sicily of the G7, which is made up of highly industrialized democracies. Also known as the G7, it includes Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how. S.V.

Brennan Williams,Thousands Of Historic Items Honoring Black Cinema Could Be Yours,"Thousands Of Historic Items Honoring Black Cinema Could Be Yours A collection celebrating 100 years of African American cinema is going on sale. By Brennan Williams Separate Cinema Archive/ SFAE The San Francisco Art Exchange announced Thursday the first public sale of pieces from the Separate Cinema Archive. 
One hundred years of black film art is officially up for grabs. 
The San Francisco Art Exchange announced Thursday the first public sale of pieces from the Separate Cinema Archive. With 35,000 items curated over the course of three decades ― including rare vintage posters, lobby cards and photographs from 30 countries ― the comprehensive archive has been committed to celebrating 100 years of African American cinema. 
“History relies on evidence, and the Separate Cinema Archive provides that,” SFAE co-founder and director Theron Kabrich said in a statement to HuffPost. “This collection pays respect to the contributions of the filmmakers and artists who literally changed history through their work.” 
Some of the notable titles and black film icons featured in the collection include “Siren of the Tropics” (which starred Josephine Baker), “In the Heat of the Night” (starring Sidney Poitier) and “12 Years a Slave.” 
Prior to SFAE’s announcement, parts of the Separate Cinema Archive have been featured in traveling exhibits at film festivals and art institutions, as well as a 2014 book published by the founder of the archive , renowned photographer and author John Kisch. 
Established in 1972, the Separate Cinema Archive highlights the rich cultural history and “and turbulent journey of the Black film industry, Black actors and directors, and indeed the arc of the struggle for African-American equality,” according to the organization’s site . 
“It’s important to note that the greatest stories in American history take place in a country that was built on slavery and involuntary servitude,” Kabrich said in the statement. “A lot of people, certainly in Hollywood, made a lot of money based on the back of that history.” 
“You see that in rich detail throughout the narrative of this collection in that it pays homage to a significant part of the population that was involved with entertainment and storytelling. And that part of the population was either marginalized or forgotten completely, ridiculously,” he added.

Caroline Bologna,Photo Series Shows Kids Enjoying Childhood Without Technology,"Photo Series Shows Kids Enjoying Childhood Without Technology “I hope they look back on it and smile.” Niki Boon photographed her children's everyday lives for a series she calls ""Childhood in the Raw."" 
A stunning photo series is showcasing the joys of a tech-free childhood. 
New Zealand photographer and mother of four, Niki Boon , documented her children’s everyday lives in a series she calls “Childhood in the Raw.” 
“This project came into being with our decision to educate our children alternatively, at home,” Boon told HuffPost. The family lives in a rural environment without modern electronic devices like TV and smartphones. Niki Boon Photography “This project came into being with our decision to educate our children alternatively, at home,” Boon told HuffPost. 
Boon said this lifestyle choice has sparked a lot of questions and criticism from friends, family and strangers. At first, even she and her husband sometimes had doubts. 
“In the beginning, the photos served as a visual document, to record things that the children were doing in a day, to reassure both others and ourselves that there was learning taking place,” the mom explained. 
“But as time went on, I became frustrated that the pictures weren’t really telling the story well enough for me. It just wasn’t with enough depth,” she continued. “So I spent many hours and late nights trying to teach myself how to take better pictures, ones that depicted what I was seeing in front of me, and tell the story the way I saw it … and things just evolved from there.” Niki Boon Photography “Like all parents we would love our children to be strong in who they are, confident, free thinkers, proactive, independent, resilient, empathetic and happy,” Boon said. 
Boon and her husband have a 12-year-old daughter and three sons, ages 7, 9 and 13. 
“Like all parents we would love our children to be strong in who they are, confident, free thinkers, proactive, independent, resilient, empathetic and happy,” she said. “I hope that, living with the land that we have, that they also gain a healthy respect for the earth, and for the animals and plants that live with us on it.” Niki Boon Photography Boon hopes her kids look back on their childhood with a sense of nostalgia. 
The photographer said her family’s alternative, tech-free lifestyle reminds her of her own childhood growing up on a farm with extended family. She told HuffPost she hopes her photos move people in some way, “negative or positive.” 
Ultimately, the mom just wants to document the wonders of her kids’ childhood. Said Boon, “I hope they look back on it and smile.” ",english,,,,,"huffpost , boon , said boon , niki boon photography boon , niki boon photography , niki boon , ","new zealand , ",,,,,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOgZ1dDOlqNQqIGPwVL.wM.aEcuQLpu2pQr46qfL6gfK3X8gc0fzdCfvpAGQ26aT1ca57c2EJ4KviTAD93S8PRazWCb3vXUm6UpG8Gv9JSUkC2mRUoS49v5jQkUwBiGMCYI-,Photo Series Shows Kids Enjoying Childhood Without Technology,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/index.xml,The Huffington Post | The Full Feed,2017-05-26T02:28:00.000+03:00,0,1,news,huffingtonpost.com,US,http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/1910_1000/591f0e42270000520090ee4a.jpeg,0,
Keith Gaby,"Pruitt's First 100 Days: He's Nothing Like Trump, And That's A Problem","Pruitt's First 100 Days: He's Nothing Like Trump, And That's A Problem In contrast to the often-dysfunctional White House, Pruitt has been laser focused. 05/25/2017 12:56 pm ET | Updated 5 days ago US EPA 
Columnists across the political spectrum have been calling President Trump names – questioning his discipline, knowledge, and focus. No one can say the same things about Scott Pruitt. 
Indeed, as we approach Pruitt’s 100th day as leader of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, it’s clear that he is nothing like the president. And that, ironically, makes him even worse for our health and environment. 
Scott Pruitt is highly disciplined, skillful and focused – and obsessed with his mission of advocating for big polluters and undermining the EPA’s historic role of protecting public health. Now that he’s in charge of the agency, he’s methodically pushing to gut rules that limit pollution, hobble enforcement of clean air and water laws, and shove aside unbiased scientific guidance. The Washington Post via Getty Images 
In contrast to the often-dysfunctional White House, Pruitt has been laser focused. In his first 100 days, he has: begun the process of abandoning the Clean Power Plan , America’s only national limits on carbon pollution from our largest source. This will allow the power plants to emit unlimited amounts of this pollution – leading to more asthma attacks and a more dangerous future for our children. taken aim at the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule , which reduces dangerous neurotoxins that harm children’s brain development. Pruitt is opposing it even though virtually all power plants in the country now comply with the rule, demonstrating that none of the fear-mongering about cost and reliability problems we heard from industry were true. actively been lobbying the White House to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement , a move that would hurt our economy and cede American leadership to China and Europe. We would join only two other countries in the world – Nicaragua and Syria – on the outside of this global system, potentially inviting tariffs on our exports. In true Alice in Wonderland fashion, the EPA administrator is reportedly lobbying the coal industry to support withdrawal from the climate agreement. appeared to be trying to shut out neutral scientific advice . He’s declined to reappoint half of a scientific advisory board, with some reports indicating he may choose more industry-friendly advisors instead. On his watch, the EPA has removed key pollution and climate data from its web site. Pruitt also claimed on CNBC that carbon dioxide is not “a primary contributor to the global warming that we see” – flatly contradicting the scientists at NASA, every major American scientific organization and his own agency. paved the way for the Trump administration’s call for a 31-percent cut to the EPA budget – more than what any other federal agency faces. If enacted, it would dramatically reduce protections against pollutants such as mercury, lead, smog, and carbon pollution; undermine enforcement of the Clean Air and Clean Water acts; and reduce cleanup of toxic waste sites. It will result in more asthma attacks for kids, more health problems for elderly Americans, accelerated climate change and more pollution in our lives. slowly been stocking his agency with appointees with serious conflicts of interest . A few examples : Nancy Beck moved from the chemical industry’s main lobbying organization to be the highest political appointee at the EPA office overseeing the chemical industry. Justin Schwab, now a top lawyer at the EPA, previously represented a coal utility. Christian Palich, a lobbyist for a coal industry group, was appointed to a senior position in the EPA’s Congressional relations office. 
The fact is, the EPA has saved countless lives and made America dramatically cleaner and healthier by sticking to sound science, seeking smart solutions to limit pollution, and enforcing the law. In his first 100 days, Scott Pruitt has turned the agency’s mission on its head. 
Estimates suggest that if he is able to fully enact his agenda, about 130,000 Americans will die prematurely due to air, water, and toxic pollution. So while America will survive Scott Pruitt’s tenure at the EPA, we know that many Americans won’t.

Bob Brinkmann,About That Mar-a-Lago Sinkhole...,"The growing problem of aging underground infrastructure is no laughing matter. 05/25/2017 12:04 pm ET | Updated 5 days ago 
When news broke last week that a sinkhole formed at Donald Trump’s resort and weekend White House known as Mar-a-Lago, the press and social media had a field day. The headline in the Washington Post declared, “ Sinkhole forms in front of Mar-a-Lago; metaphors pour in .” Twitter went full snark. Even Cher got into the laughfest . 
Many who know me as a Florida sinkhole expert forwarded several articles about the collapse. By all reports, the sinkhole was a small 4-foot square collapse feature. 
But was it really a sinkhole? 
When I heard the news, I was highly skeptical. 
A sinkhole is a collapse of a void space that forms from the solution of soluble rock—usually limestone. 
In Florida, most of the limestone that contains void spaces large enough to cause a sinkhole the size of the one at Mar-a-Lago is found near the surface in central Florida near Tampa and Orlando. Some large sinkholes in this area have caused tremendous property damage and loss of life. 
But Mar-a-Lago? According to state geologic maps of Palm Beach County, the site is underlain by the Anastasia formation, a geologic unit consisting of a mix of late Pleistocene sands and a type of limestone called coquina—a weakly cemented rock made of shells. While sinkholes can form in the formation, they are not at all a common occurrence. 
So if it wasn’t a sinkhole, what was it? 
The Palm Beach Daily News is reporting that it was a collapsed stormwater pipe and not a sinkhole—at least not a geologic sinkhole. 
In recent years, we have taken to using the term sinkhole for any collapse feature that suddenly forms on the surface of the earth. Geologists shudder at the expansion of the definition away from the purely geologic. But to the general public, there is little difference. Whether sinkholes form from collapsed pipes or from collapsed limestone, the resultant holes cause disruptions in our communities and in our daily lives. 
Recently, the Associated Press published an article by Roger Schneider about the growing national problem of sinkholes that form from collapsing aging underground infrastructure. Each year, local governments spend millions of dollars on repairs and countless people are inconvenienced when holes open up on roadways, sidewalks, parking lots, and even under buildings as a result of collapses similar to the one at Mar-a-Lago. 
While it is easy to have a good chuckle at the President’s expense about the sinkhole at Mar-a-Lago, the growing problem of aging underground infrastructure is no laughing matter.

Jessica Samakow,A GOP Candidate 'Body-Slamming' A Reporter Is A Symptom Of Trump Culture,"05/25/2017 02:52 pm ET | Updated 2 days ago Toxic Masculinity And The Unsurprising 'Body-Slamming' Of A Reporter Greg Gianforte is a symptom of Trump culture. By Jessica Samakow 
Precisely one month before the presidential election, The Washington Post released audio of then-candidate Donald Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women. 
As the shocking tape spread rapidly across the internet, the media largely assumed the race was over — that admitting to sexual assault would be disqualifying, that we could never elect a man who jokes about violence. It wasn’t, and we did. 
Trump chalked his comments up to “locker room talk,” and his supporters followed suit. They insisted this is just the type of banter we should expect of boys and men, this is just the normal stuff guys talk about when girls are not around. Many Republican officials did condemn the tape, but most did not abandon him. 
The message sent to the American public was clear: Abuse isn’t fantastic, but it’s not that big of a deal, either. The expectation of basic respect for other human beings diminishes when harmful values are valorized from the top down. 
Fast forward seven months, and a GOP House candidate is dealing with the aftermath of reportedly body-slamming a reporter . According to an audio recording and eyewitness reports, The Guardian’s Ben Jacobs attempted to ask Republican congressional candidate Greg Gianforte, who is running in Montana’s special election, a question about his stance on the GOP health care bill in light of the Congressional Budget Office score . 
Fox News’ Alicia Acuna, who was in the room, had this to say about what happened next : “Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground behind him. Faith, Keith and I watched in disbelief as Gianforte then began punching the reporter.” 
“I’m sick and tired of you guys!” Gianforte yelled at Jacobs. Greg Gianforte just body slammed me and broke my glasses — Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) May 24, 2017 
The incident is horrifying, yet given the current political climate, the negative rhetoric about the press, and the attitudes of the man who now sits in the White House, it’s not totally surprising. Americans placed a vessel of toxic masculinity into the highest office in the nation, and now we’re watching the inevitable trickle down. 
Montana’s Billings Gazette rescinded their endorsement of Gianforte Thursday morning , noting how his past behavior must be looked at differently now. 
“We’d point out that all the other questionable interactions Gianforte had with reporters, including one case where he joked about ganging up on a reporter, must now be seen through a much more sinister lens. What he passed off as a joke at the time now becomes much more serious,” wrote the Gazette’s editorial board. 
Of course, Gianforte’s previous “joke ” about wringing a reporter’s neck was no cause for alarm. Because this is what happens when the country rejects a zero tolerance policy when it comes to physical violence. This is what happens when we give abuse a pass. This is what happens when the President of the United States repeatedly calls journalists “enemies of the American people” and encourages his supporters to harass them. Americans placed a vessel of toxic masculinity into the highest office in the nation, and now we’re watching the inevitable trickle down. 
No, Donald Trump did not singlehandedly cause Gianforte to become violent, and Gianforte may have lashed out in the same way if someone else were President of the United States. But Trump has undoubtedly encouraged an atmosphere in which groups he targets become victims of violence . 
“In the past three weeks, political reporters have described being arrested, pinned against a wall, slapped, and now body-slammed,” HuffPost’s Michael Calderone notes. 
It remains to be seen whether Gianforte or his Democratic opponent, Rob Quist, will win the race. What we do know, is that the conversation surrounding the acceptability of physical violence has shifted since 2015. 
A reporter was trying to hold a candidate accountable by asking questions ― an action that’s both routine to the function of journalism and necessary for democracy ― and somehow his assault has become a partisan issue, something to debate, something to “take a side” on. Supporters and pundits aren’t rejecting Gianforte’s behavior wholesale, and that’s because the culture our president and his leadership team enforce has given them permission not to. 
BuzzFeed’s Charlie Warzel noted the praise he’s seeing on Twitter from Trump supporters: i follow prob 200 pro-Trump accounts. seeing a decent amt of this in my timeline right now https://t.co/haQidD4QqN — Charlie Warzel (@cwarzel) May 25, 2017 . @GregForMontana sir u are a serious badass, we all salute u sir for the great deed u did today for this country, a true patriot! — Dagny Delinquent ?? (@DagnyDelinquent) May 25, 2017 
Fox News’ Laura Ingraham went so far as to compare Jacobs to a tattle-tale child, and asked what other Montana men would do if body-slammed, implying that “real men” fight back: Politicians always need to keep their cool. But what would most Montana men do if ""body slammed"" for no reason by another man? — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) May 25, 2017 Did anyone get his lunch money stolen today and then run to tell the recess monitor? — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) May 25, 2017 
And as the Associated Press’ Mary Clare Jalonick reports, a GOP Congressman from California had this to say: Rep. Duncan Hunter said of MT reporter assault, “It’s not appropriate behavior. Unless the reporter deserved it.” — Mary Clare Jalonick (@MCJalonick) May 25, 2017 
The notion that being a man requires using brute force to get what you want, what you believe you deserve ― whether that be a woman’s pussy or the ability to dodge a tough policy question ― is all part of one toxic masculine package. These ideas existed before Trump and they will outlast him, but the expectation of basic respect for other human beings diminishes when harmful values are valorized from the top down. 
As the narrative surrounding the election goes: It’s not that Trump’s supporters voted for him because he was an abuser, they voted for him despite that. But the unfortunate truth is that intent doesn’t matter. The result is still the same, and a man who brags about sexual violence and calls the press an “enemy” is now running the country. A legitimization of dangerous ideas about what it means to be a man was always going to be part of the package deal. 
Greg Gianforte’s assault of a reporter is one more manifestation of Trump culture. This is the country we live in now.

Nida Khan,Trump Paved The Way For Montana Politician's Body Slam,"Trump Paved The Way For Montana Politician's Body Slam Donald Trump set a hostile precedent for how to treat journalists during his campaign. 05/25/2017 12:29 pm ET | Updated 1 day ago Justin Sullivan via Getty Images 
Journalists have long been the target of attacks, harassment, acts of intimidation, arrests and even death around the world. In this country however, most journalists and most Americans for that matter, have been shielded from some of the harsher realities the press faces in other parts of the globe. That all may be changing now – and it’s not a good thing. 
Wednesday night, news broke that Guardian’s reporter Ben Jacobs was allegedly body-slammed by House GOP candidate Greg Gianforte on the eve of Montana’s special election. According to Fox News reporters who were in the room when the attack reportedly happened: “Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground behind him.” They go on to say that they watched in disbelief as Gianforte then began punching the reporter. 
Perhaps the most damning part of the entire account is when the eyewitnesses say: “To be clear, at no point did any of us who witnessed this assault see Jacobs show any form of physical aggression toward Gianforte, who left the area after giving statements to local sheriff’s deputies.” 
Prior to the release of the Fox News account, Gianforte’s office put out a defensive statement which included the following: “Greg then attempted to grab the phone that was pushed in his face. Jacobs grabbed Greg’s wrist, and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground. It’s unfortunate that this aggressive behavior from a liberal journalist created this scene at our campaign volunteer BBQ.” 
This framing of a ‘liberal journalist’ or ‘liberal media’ is nothing new. We’ve heard it time and again from conservative politicians, pundits and the right’s echo chamber for years now (despite the fact that most media isn’t liberal by any stretch of that word). What’s different now however is that we’re in an environment where open vitriol and aggression against the press have become normalized – and its no coincidence. 
All throughout the campaign trail, Donald Trump verbally attacked the media, riled up his crowds to do the same and created a tense atmosphere for the dedicated journalists covering his events. He would often point to the press penned in somewhere at his rallies and make statements like “See the dishonest people back there?” To which his loyalists would repeat such antagonistic statements, or throw their own insults right in reporters’ faces who were usually only separated from the crowds by metal barricades. Many tweeted, wrote and discussed how uncomfortable they sometimes felt at these campaign rallies. 
Trump clearly played the role of victim; the entire system was “rigged” and the “dishonest media” was out to get him. It was actually a brilliant strategy. Portraying himself as somehow the underdog, even though the self-proclaimed billionaire was backed by some of the most powerful entities (and money) around. Tapping into right-wing talking points against the media that have infiltrated the minds of millions of Americans through outlets like Fox News, he just articulated what many on the right have been saying to themselves for years. 
Now one could possibly dismiss Trump’s anti-media statements as just mere strategy if it weren’t for his continued attacks against the press once in office. He has not only regularly referred to them as “fake news” (whenever he didn’t agree with their coverage), but the President of the United States has gone so far as to call the media “the enemy of the American people.” No one should take that lightly. 
A free and independent press is one of the bedrock principles upon which this country has always functioned. Holding power accountable and being a check on government is what journalists have done throughout history because that is their fundamental purpose. Has the media failed to do so at times? Of course. One need only look at the colossal failure of the press to do its job leading up to the Iraq war where they often served as a mouthpiece for government talking points and failed to adequately question things. But overall, journalists and the press at large do incredible work parsing through the noise, investigating, probing, getting answers, representing the public’s interest and getting truth and information to the people. Trump’s relentless attacks on the media are not only outrageous, but they are downright dangerous. 
Recently, news broke about Trump reportedly asking then-FBI Director Comey to end the investigation into his former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. But buried in this bombshell story was accusations that Trump reportedly also told Comey he should consider jailing reporters who published classified information. Let me repeat: that we should consider throwing journalists in jail, this is where we are. 
Around the world, reporters are targeted, arrested and thrown behind bars every single day. Authoritarian regimes crush dissidents on a regular basis, often going after journalists first. In 2016, some 259 journalists were jailed worldwide according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). The nation with the highest number of jailed journalists? You guessed it, Turkey. 
Earlier this month, President Trump welcomed Turkish President Erdogan to the White House. The same Erdogan who has cracked down on news outlets, shut down papers and TV stations (more than 100), and thrown journalists in jail. According to the CPJ, there are at least 81 journalists imprisoned in Turkey as of December 2016 – all of them facing anti-state charges. Erdogan’s security team is also accused of violently attacking protesters outside the Turkish Ambassador’s residence here in Washington D.C. as Erdogan allegedly looked on during this recent visit. 
Erdogan’s attempts to hold on to power and silence his critics are beyond troubling, and the fact that our President reportedly made comments about jailing journalists should bother everyone who believes in democracy, a free press and a society that isn’t ruled with an ironed fist. 
Late last night, Gianforte was cited for misdemeanor assault. We have yet to see if this helps or hinders his bid for Montana’s seat. While the outcome will speak volumes on where we are as a society, just remember that Trump won the Presidency making all kinds of disparaging statements against the press and inciting others to do the same. Now he thinks he’s some sort of King himself. Thankfully all the hard-working journalists out here will gladly remind him that he’s not with every stroke of their pen and every word they type.

Kristen Hewitt,Arts Education Must Go On: Setting the Stage for a Successful Solution | HuffPost,"Arts Education Must Go On: Setting the Stage for a Successful Solution 05/24/2017 06:55 pm ET 
There are times in education when it’s especially important to sit up straight and pay attention. One of those times is now. The arts programming in public schools across the nation, for years threatened by budget cuts and political shifts, is in great danger. Photo by Justin Namon 
According to an NEA report , at-risk students who have access to the arts in or out of school also tend to have better academic results, better workforce opportunities and more civic engagement. Perhaps more than ever, innovative programs that breathe life into public education through the arts are needed. Take the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts of Miami-Dade County as a prime example. The Center’s unique partnership with the Miami-Dade County Public Schools system, the fourth largest in the nation, has led to the development of Learning Through the Arts . This a successful model for how an institution can partner with its school district to create equal access for all to transformative arts experiences – with the potential to inspire others nationwide. 
As part of this program, the Arsht Center developed Rock Odyssey , which puts a vibrant and theatrical spin on Homer’s Odyssey. More than 175,000 fifth grade students across the county have experienced Rock Odyssey at the Arsht Center for free since 2010. Each year, the Center buses in elementary school students to experience the musical. Prior to the show, teachers and students participate in workshops that provide curriculum learning tools that help maximize the experience. 
“When working on programs for kids, it is critical to cater to their unique needs at each stage of development,” said Jairo Ontiveros, director for education and community engagement at the Adrienne Arsht Center. “Find what ignites that spark, and you’ve just planted the seed for a love of the arts.” 
A Program That’s Really Taking Off Photo by Justin Namon 
Making education come alive through Rock Odyssey is only the beginning. Its overwhelming success is driving an expansion of the Arsht Center’s Learning Through the Arts program. Set to take off in Fall 2017, a musical -- Kitty Hawk -- will bring the Wright Brothers’ pursuit of flight to thousands of seventh graders in the Miami-Dade Public School System, perhaps inspiring the next generation of engineers and innovators. Miami-Dade County Public Schools will integrate key learnings from the show into the seventh-grade curriculum to create a holistic experience. 
“ Kitty Hawk makes learning about Wilbur and Orville Wright’s historic first flight fun, entertaining and educational,” said John Richard, president & CEO of the Adrienne Arsht Center. “This unique performance goes beyond science, technology, engineering and math learning, in essence adding the ARTS to STEM education to make ‘STEAM’ and preparing our next generation of community leaders.” 
More than ever programs such as this are needed to fuel and cultivate the next generation of inspired minds – the world’s next great artists, inventors and engineers.

Cavan Sieczkowski,Melania Trump Will Be The First Catholic To Live At The White House Since JFK,"Melania Trump Will Be The First Catholic To Live At The White House Since JFK The first lady is a practicing Catholic, her spokeswoman confirmed. By Cavan Sieczkowski 
When first lady Melania Trump finally moves into the White House this summer, she will become its first Roman Catholic resident in more than 50 years. 
Following Wednesday’s trip to the Vatican to meet with Pope Francis, Trump’s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, confirmed to the Daily Mail that the first lady is, in fact, a practicing Catholic . This will make her the first Catholic living at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. since John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jackie, in the early 1960s. President Donald Trump is Presbyterian . Today's visit with His Holiness Pope Francis @Pontifex is one I'll never forget. I was humbled by the honor. Blessings to all. pic.twitter.com/NiomkFQqJb — Melania Trump (@FLOTUS) May 24, 2017 
Anti-Catholic prejudice was part of the American mainstream when Kennedy was campaigning to become president on the Democratic ticket in 1960. He said that year that he would not let his faith interfere with his responsibility to the public if elected. 
“I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute, where no Catholic prelate would tell the president (should he be Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote; where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference; and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the president who might appoint him or the people who might elect him,” Kennedy said. 
Trump, born Melanija Knavs in Communist Slovenia, became the second Catholic first lady to meet with a pope with her family’s visit to the Vatican this week, Philly.com noted. (Jackie Kennedy was the first.) During the trip, FLOTUS ― who wore a long-sleeved black dress with a black mantilla in line with traditional rules ― had a set of rosary beads blessed by Francis . 
She and son Barron are reportedly set to move to the White House full time in June. For now, they are living in Trump Tower in New York.

Alon Ben-Meir,Trump’s ‘Historic’ Visit To The Middle East: Much Ado About Nothing,"Trump’s ‘Historic’ Visit To The Middle East: Much Ado About Nothing 05/25/2017 12:41 pm ET | Updated 3 hours ago 
Sadly, President Trump’s visit to the Middle East only confirmed my skepticism about what might come out of it. Trump went to the region with nothing to offer to mitigate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and received no commitment from either Israeli or Palestinian leaders to resume the peace negotiations in earnest, but he received lots of platitudes and empty good-will gestures. 
In his meeting with the Saudi King Salman and the rest of the heads of Arab states, he heard the chanting against the Iranian threat and joined the chorus without offering any specific idea as to how he might address Iran’s support of violent extremists and its hegemonic ambitions. 
To be sure, however, there were many photo ops. Israeli and Arab officials alike clamored to take a photo with a besieged President who is reveling in the accolades of the moment and doing his best not to think about the dark clouds awaiting him back home. 
That said, there is no doubt that the US remains the indispensable power in the Middle East, and just about every state in the region relies heavily on the US’ political support and protection. This, however, does not suggest that the US has a magic wand and can simply wave it and change overnight the dynamics of the multiple conflicts sweeping and consuming the region. None of Trump’s predecessors has had that kind of power and Trump has even less. 
During his meetings with Saudi officials, he said nothing about their gross violation of human rights and the kingdom’s promotion of Islamic Wahhabi extremism. On the contrary, he was delighted to conclude an arms deal worth over $110 billion, becoming more like a merchant of death rather than a messenger of peace. 
On the relationship between the Arab states and Israel, Trump offered no recipe as to how they can reach a comprehensive peace agreement. He stated that “King Salman feels very strongly and, I can tell you, would love to see peace with Israel and the Palestinians.” 
The fact is that the Arab states want peace between Israel and the Palestinians based on a two-state solution, and conditioned normalization of relations with Israel based on that premise, which was articulated in the Arab Peace Initiative introduced by the Arab League in 2002. 
On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Trump seems to have realized that the conflict is far more intractable than when he stated before his trip that “There is no reason there’s not peace between Israel and the Palestinians—none whatsoever.” But once he listened to the Israelis and Palestinians, he stated that “I’ve heard it’s one of the toughest deals of all.” 
Whereas he took no initiative to advance the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, to the chagrin of Netanyahu and his cohorts, Trump backtracked on his promise to relocate the US embassy to Jerusalem and asked Netanyahu to slow down the building and expansion of settlements. To the disappointment of many in Israel, he refused to allow any Israeli officials to accompany him during his historic visit to the Western Wall. 
The statements made by Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas that they are ready and willing to resume negotiations are old, tired, and inconsequential. Both sides have been expressing such a sentiment for years, and nothing that Trump has said or done will change the positions of either Abbas or Netanyahu. 
Netanyahu is not committed to a two-state solution, and Abbas is unable to make any concession and politically (if not physically) survive. Trump could have challenged both leaders to take some measures to demonstrate their commitment to peace and create a conducive atmosphere that would pave the way for serious negotiations, but he did not even attempt to do just that. 
Among other measures, Trump could have asked Netanyahu to release some Palestinians prisoners, allow for freer movement of Palestinians, and open the door for mutual tourism. Trump could have also leaned on Abbas to stop public incitements and acrimonious public narratives, and end financial aid to the families of terrorists. 
Although Trump does want a deal, he assigned his son-in-law Jared Kushner and former Trump Organization attorney Jason Greenblatt, two novice individuals who know even less about the complexity of the conflict than he does, to find a solution that has eluded several presidents before him. 
Notwithstanding their desire to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the Iranian threat assumes greater urgency for both Israel and the Arab states. Both sides have long since concluded that Iran is a common enemy and poses a real danger to their national security. As they see it, although the Iran deal has delayed its pursuit of nuclear weapons, Tehran is still committed to becoming a nuclear power. 
Regarding the concern over the Iranian threat, Trump said nothing that was not known before: “There is a growing realization among your [Israel] Arab neighbors that they have common cause with you in the threat posed by Iran, and it is indeed a threat, there’s no question about that.” 
It is true that Tehran is deliberately destabilizing the region by its support of terrorist organizations and by meddling in the Arabs’ domestic affairs (Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen) to serve its hegemonic ambition. Israel and the Arab states have for several years been collaborating strategically by sharing intelligence and developing clandestine security cooperation to stop Iran from realizing its regional objectives. 
Other than boasting by stating that “We are telling you right now that Iran will not have nuclear weapons”, Trump offered no concrete steps as to how to deal with the Iranian menace. Instead, he encouraged the Sunni Arab states to ally against Shiite Iran, which can only further heighten tensions between the two sides and further destabilize the region, which is already in turmoil. 
Trump ignores the basic fact that regardless of Iran’s mischiefs and transgressions, it is here to stay. Tehran has been complying to all the provisions of the nuclear deal and it has just reelected President Rouhani, who is a moderate and expressed on many occasions that he wants to improve relations with the US and the Arab states. 
However, Trump’s statement to the Sunni leaders was: “Until the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism, and pray for the day when the Iranian people have the just and righteous government they so richly deserve.” 
Indeed, regardless of the intense objection of the Israelis and the Arab states to the Iran deal, Trump did not tear it up as he promised during his campaign for President, and his administration continues to fully comply with the deal’s requirements by lifting the sanctions as stipulated in the accord. 
Wisdom dictates that the US should build on the Iran deal, and work with Iran to help bring an end to the horrifying civil war in Syria and stop the senseless proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia in Yemen and Iraq, from which neither side can emerge victorious. 
Trump’s visit to the region was full of opulence and symbolism, with little or no substance. There was no progress in in the search for a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Arab states continue to refuse to normalize relations with Israel before resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and they have received no assurance that the US will deal with Iran with an iron fist. 
The only thing that came out of Trump’s visit is that he could get a respite from the political turmoil in which he is marred back home. Otherwise, the trip was much ado about nothing.

Zahara Hill,Kalief Browder Now Has A Street Named After Him In The Bronx,"Kalief Browder Now Has A Street Named After Him In The Bronx He would have turned 24 this May. By Zahara Hill 
A Bronx intersection has been renamed in honor of the late Kalief Browder on what would have been his 24th birthday. 
Browder took his life at 22 years old in his family’s Bronx home after a traumatizing three-year imprisonment at Rikers Island . In March, Spike TV aired “ TIME: The Kalief Browder Story ,” a six-part documentary series that shed light on the repeated injustices Browder faced. He went to Rikers at 16 for allegedly stealing a backpack, but was never convicted. 
The Thursday morning unveiling of Kalief Browder Way ― at the intersection of Prospect Avenue and East 181 Street ― is just one of a number of remembrances to take place after the airing of the docuseries, which was executive produced by Jay Z. The unveiling of Kalief Browder Way on what would have been his 24th birthday. #KaliefBrowder pic.twitter.com/H25fZvOeGT — SPIKE (@spike) May 25, 2017 
Just a week before the docuseries’ final episode in late March, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a 10-year plan to close Rikers . On April 10, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ― alongside Browder’s family ― signed a bill to prohibit the state from continuing to charge 16- and 17-year-olds as adults. In that same month, city Public Advocate Letitia James began campaigning for the island to be named after Browder when the prison closes. 
The unveiling was hosted by Browder’s family, members of the City Council and criminal justice reform advocates.

Taylor Pittman,The First Trailer For Beloved YA Book-Turned-Movie 'Wonder' Is Here,"The First Trailer For Beloved YA Book-Turned-Movie 'Wonder' Is Here ""You can't blend in when you were born to stand out."" By Taylor Pittman 
Devoted fans of the YA book “Wonder” are in for a treat because Lionsgate Movies has finally dropped the first trailer for the movie adaptation. 
Written by Raquel Jaramillo under the pen name R.J. Palacio , “Wonder” captures the life of fifth-grader Auggie Pullman, who has a facial deformity for which he has undergone multiple surgeries. In the movie, Jacob Tremblay , who made waves in Hollywood after starring in the Oscar-nominated film “Room,” portrays Auggie. His co-stars include Owen Wilson , Julia Roberts , Mandy Patinkin and “Hamilton” star Daveed Diggs . 
The trailer, which has been trending on YouTube, highlights Auggie’s struggles as he begins fifth grade and as he gets bullied and finds it difficult to make friends. In the end, he ends up teaching his peers an important lesson. The focus of the movie seems to be summed up in one line in the trailer: “You can’t blend in when you were born to stand out.”

Brittany Wong,23 Crazy-Hot Asian Dudes Who Shatter Stereotypes About Masculinity,"05/25/2017 03:35 pm ET | Updated 6 days ago 23 Crazy-Fine Asian Dudes Who Don't Conform To Western Standards Of Hotness You're welcome. By Brittany Wong 
Let’s face it: When it comes to who is considered “hot,” we tend to default to traditional Eurocentric and Western standards . We’re talking narrow noses, large, non-almond-shaped eyes and pale skin. 
For men of Asian descent , that means their good looks too often go overlooked. Asian guys are rarely cast as male romantic leads in movies or TV; as Netflix’s “Iron Fist” showed us, they frequently get passed over for white guys. They have more difficulty finding dates online than other racial groups ― and get called undateable by the likes of Steve Harvey . (Remember when the TV host laughed at the idea of white women finding Asian dudes attractive? Yeah, who could forget.) 
We’re here to call out all that B.S. There’s one reason Asian men shouldn’t have to conform to Western standards of masculinity and hotness: They’re sexy as hell on their own. 
Below, 23 guys who are upending ideas about what it means to be attractive and masculine by sheer virtue of their good looks.

Julie R. Thomson,How To Keep Your Food Safe At Your Weekend Cookout,"How To Keep Your Food Safe At Your Weekend Cookout Let's make this a memorable holiday -- but in a good way. By Julie R. Thomson 
There’s a reason people in the food service industry are trained and tested on safe kitchen practices. Food safety is no joke, and the risk of dangerous foodborne bacteria is very real. And when we bring food out of kitchens and into the great outdoors, where temperatures aren’t regulated, it becomes even more serious. 
Dining outdoors is great in the warmer months, but it also means that our food can get warmer than is safe. If improperly stored, or cross-contamination happens, the growth of foodborne bacteria multiplies. 
Let’s all stay safe this summer. Here are a list of things outlined by the FDA to keep in mind before you start planning your next outdoor meal ― and make sure that you don’t make your friends and family sick. fishysam via Getty Images A cooler packed of food. 
1. Keep cold foods cold. Pack a cooler with ice or ice packs to ensure cold food will be stored below 40 degrees. And consider packing drinks in a separate cooler to keep the opening of the cold food cooler to a minimum. Also, keep this cooler out of direct sunlight as much as possible. 
2. Keep hot foods hot. Hot food should be kept at a temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit or above. You can use a thermos or insulated container. Or, if you’ve just grilled food, keep it hot until ready to serve by moving it to the side of the grill rack away from the heat. Do not partially cook food unless you can finish cooking it right away ― for example. if you’re taking it from the stove to a grill outside. 
3. Be wary of the “Danger Zone.” For food, the danger zone is any temperature above 40 degrees F (for cold foods) and under 140 degrees F (for hot foods). If foods are kept in the danger zone temperatures for over two hours, they should be tossed. If the outdoor temperature is above 90 degrees, foods should be tossed just after an hour. 
4. Don’t cross-contaminate. You might not even realize you’re doing it, but it’s one of the surest ways to make people sick. Don’t reuse a plate or utensil that may have been in contact with raw meat, poultry or seafood. This is very important to remember when serving cooked food from a grill, but also something to keep in mind when packing a cooler. Keep raw meat, poultry and seafood securely wrapped to make sure no raw juices get in contact with the other contents of your cooler. 
5. Use a thermometer. Bring a meat thermometer and use it. The cooking temperatures you’re looking for are outlined in the chart below. And, consider using an appliance thermometer for your cold cooler too ― just to make sure it’s chilling below 40 degrees. FDA Print this out, and keep it handy. 
6. Wash your hands. Just do it, even if you don’t have access to running water. You can use a jug of water and soap ― or even a moist towelette in a pinch. Just keep your hands clean. 
Follow all those rules, and you can dine al fresco without a care in the world.

Julie R. Thomson,Worried That Grilling Will Give You Cancer? Here Are Some Safeguards You Can Take,"Worried That Grilling Will Give You Cancer? Here Are Some Safeguards You Can Take Here's how to be smart about it. Sarah Klein and Julie R. Thomson HuffPost grandriver via Getty Images 
With most of the country ready to fire up their grills for Memorial Day, you might be worrying about all those cancer claims surrounding grilled foods. Before we partake in a weekend of charred burgers, seared steaks and other grilled meals , let’s look into this a little more closely. Why is there cancer risk associated with grilled foods? 
The reason there is concern revolving around grilled food, mostly meat, has to do with two compounds that are both known carcinogens: heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). HCAs form in protein-rich foods when cooked at very high heat, and PAHs form when fat burns on the grill, creating smoke. 
According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), studies have found that a diet rich in HCAs has been linked to an increased risk of breast, colon, liver, skin, lung, prostate and other cancers. Diets high in PAH have been linked to leukemia . 
But Colleen Doyle ―MS, RD, the director of nutrition and physical activity for the American Cancer Society (ACS) ― says that there isn’t enough evidence to suggest that you stay away from the grill entirely. Instead, take some steps to minimize the risk of these compounds. What can I do to minimize the cancer-related risks? 
- Clean your grill. You want to keep the grill pristine because char can build up on the grates, and it’s the char that you want to minimize. There are a couple of different ways you can do that. You can scrub it with baking soda , or you can use a wad of tin foil to scrub it off. 
- Cook lean meats. Cooking lean meats means there will be less fat that drips and creates smoke, which means less potential for the presence of PAHs. Consider opting for grilled chicken (skinless is best, because it has less fat) and fish instead of red meat, as they naturally contain lower levels of the amino acids that lead to HCA production. Fish gets bonus points because it typically doesn’t have to cook as long as meat ― and the shorter the cooking time at high heat, the better. 
- Finish on the grill. If you can, start by cooking the meat partly off the grill, either in the oven or on the stove. Many great rib recipes are made this way. Then pop it on the grill at the end of the cooking process just to get that nice sear and smoky flavor. Or, if you are really committed to the grill, use it to cook low and slow. HCAs begin to form at and above 325 degrees Fahrenheit, so if you keep the temperature below that, you’re golden. Just be sure to check the meat with a thermometer to cook it to the proper, safe temperature . Undercooked meat and the risk for foodborne illness could be just as dangerous as potential carcinogens you get from grilling. 
- Marinate your meat. There’s mounting evidence that the way you prepare your meat can make a difference, says Doyle. Marinating meat even just for 30 minutes seems to limit carcinogen formation . A number of spices, in addition to adding fun flavor, seem to offer particular protection, including red pepper, thyme, sage, garlic and especially rosemary , Health.com reported. 
- Cut off any charred parts. According to the NCI, removing charred portions of meat before eating them can reduce HCA and PAH exposure . 
Remember, at the end of the day, not enough research has been done to indicate that you should stop eating grilled meats, so you can still grill steaks and burgers . But if you want to be on the safe side, follow the steps we’ve just listed.

Caroline Bologna,These Are The Hottest Baby Name Trends Of The Past Decade,"These Are The Hottest Baby Name Trends Of The Past Decade Are Juniper and Jayceon the next Jennifer and Jason? Nameberry ASharpPhoto via Getty Images 
If you want to give your baby a name that transcends this decade, make sure it doesn’t start with Ad-, end with –ley, contain the letter ‘x,’ or honor a dead celebrity. 
That’s what Nameberry found when we analyzed the Social Security baby names data of 2016 versus 2006 to identify which names have exploded in use over the past ten years. Then we looked at patterns among these hotter-than-hot names that indicate the major baby name trends right now. 
According to our research, Juniper and Jayceon may well prove as emblematic of our times as Jennifer and Jason are of the 1970s. Here is our statistical analysis of the dominant baby name trends of the decade and the hot baby names that influenced them. Ad- Names for Girls 
Adalynn is 31 times as popular now as it was in 2006, followed by Adaline which is 26 times as popular, Addilyn at 21 times, and Adley at 19 times. Add to this the status of Adeline and sisters as the sixth most popular girls’ name of 2016 when all spellings are combined and you have the major baby name trend for girls of the decade. 
And this trend will undoubtedly burn brighter before it dims, given that it’s still largely invisible. The most popular form of the name, Adeline, is all the way down at number 63 on the new list of Top 1000 Baby Names , which means that many parents have no idea how widespread the name is. Lee Names For Boys And Girls 
Names that end in the ‘lee’ sound are booming for both girls and boys. Paislee is the third hottest girls’ name, 31 times as popular now as it was a decade ago, along with Blakely, 19 times more popular; Henley, 16 times; and Paisley, 15 times. 
More surprising is the companion boom in boys’ names that end with the lee sound. Brantley is the second hottest name for boys, 27 times more popular than it was in 2006, along with Bentley, now 24 times more popular than in 2006; Finnley, 17 times; and Kingsley, 12 times. Tommaso Boddi via Getty Images Shooting Star Names 
Hot young celebrities who manage to stay in the spotlight for more than a reality TV season or two can propel their names into major trends, the way Shirley Temple did in the 1930s or Debbie Reynolds did in the 1950s. 
The hottest celebrity baby names of this decade are Isla, as in Fisher, with a 27 times increase in popularity; Leighton, as in Gossip Girl star Meester, up 20 times; Bristol, as in Palin, up 19 times; and Mila, as in Kunis, up 13 times. 
On the boys’ side is Jayceon, with 31 times as many babies given that name in 2016 as in 2006. It’s inspired by rapper The Game, who pronounces his name jay-cee-on, though others pronounce the name as jay-son or jay-shawn, making it the perfect heir to former hottie Jason, with new nature name Juniper on the hot list for girls. Superlative Names 
Baby, your name is Legend ... literally. Names that tell the world how extraordinary your child is rule today. The name Legend is 18 times more popular for boys now than it was a decade ago, while Major and King are each up 12 times. 
Girls are great too, with Royalty, the hottest girls’ name of 2016, up 58 times over its 2006 numbers, and Reign up 13 times. Harry Benson via Getty Images Tragic Celebrity Surnames 
The names of hallowed stars of the past are enjoying a new turn in the limelight as their tragic ends fade from memory. 
Two celebrity surnames, Lennon and Monroe, are among the decade’s hottest names for girls, up 19 times and 13 times. The boys’ name that fits this category is Hendrix, as in rocker Jimi, 18 times more popular now than it was in 2006..

Nina Golgowski,Wannabe 'Joker' Charged With Waving Gun At Passing Cars,"05/25/2017 02:56 pm ET Wannabe 'Joker' Charged With Waving Gun At Passing Cars Lawrence Patrick Sullivan bragged that he was “treated like a celebrity” after he was locked up on a gun charge. By Nina Golgowski 
A real-life clown faces gun charges after police accused him of waving a loaded pistol at passing cars in Miami. 
Lawrence Patrick Sullivan, whose tattooed face and green hair resemble the Batman villain, the Joker, was booked Tuesday on a charge of carrying a concealed firearm without a permit, the Miami Herald reported. 
Miami Dade Police said Sullivan, 29, was armed with a handgun loaded with six rounds of ammunition when he walked outside of an apartment complex and began pointing the weapon at passing cars. Miami Dade PD Lawrence Patrick Sullivan, 29, is accused of pointing a gun at people in Miami. 
Sullivan, speaking to reporters outside a detention center, denied doing anything criminal. 
“If I was waving a gun, yeah, I will admit it. I was not waving a gun. Did I have a gun in my pocket while I was walking my dog at the time? Yes, because I want to be safe,” he told CBS Miami. Sullivan later contradicted himself, telling reporters he was armed with a knife, not a gun. 
Sullivan said he will fight the charge. He insisted the handgun is registered in his name, and said he doesn’t need a gun permit because “we live in America.” 
He defiantly added that he was “treated like a celebrity” while behind bars in a psych ward, which he said is where he was jailed because he takes medication. CBS Miami The 29-year-old is facing a charge of carrying a concealed firearm without a permit. 
Sullivan’s family told reporters that while he may have had a gun, they don’t believe he threatened anyone. 
“He’s a good kid. You know. He has a lot of tattoos,” his mother told CBS Miami. “But he’s a nice kid with some problems. He is mentally disabled and is handicapped.” 
As for his tattoos, which include the word “Joker” and a profane Batman logo on his forehead, Sullivan’s sister told NBC Miami: “He’s just playing a character. I warned him that people would take it the wrong way.” Related...",english,,,,,,,,,,,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOhn8NudKoiujpNC9HD1QIZbT8r3kBkoXSW1IKrDyBtRFXgAGWvGUK2Q3QuYP8t2qiern92z4koGig--,Wannabe 'Joker' Charged With Waving Gun At Passing Cars,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/index.xml,The Huffington Post | The Full Feed,2017-05-26T02:56:00.000+03:00,0,1,news,huffingtonpost.com,US,http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/1910_1000/59270dce1600002100ddcd49.jpeg?cache=e75njjjn7h,1,

“I don’t think you get celebrated enough.” 
This was Rihanna’s message to young people during her speech at the 69th annual Parsons School of Design benefit on Monday night. The pop star, wearing a pantsuit designed by a Parsons graduate , was there to be honored by the fashion school for her work as both a style icon and a humanitarian. 
The singer’s acceptance speech was directed at the students, and how they deserve much more credit for their contributions to the world than they receive. 
“You should be celebrated for every aspect of your growth and your growing pains,” Rihanna, who partnered with Donna Karan to lead a school fellowship program, said. Jamie McCarthy via Getty Images Rihanna in a suit designed by Parsons graduate Matthew Adams Dolan. 
“You should be celebrated for your creativity, for your fearlessness, for your persistence and determination. You should be celebrated for all the effort that you put into building your future, for being different, for not being given enough credit—for not having to use eye cream! My point is, we often tear our youth down when we should be building them up. At the end of the day, our future is in their hands.” 
The singer gave a similarly inspiring message in March, when she accepted Harvard’s Humanitarian of the Year award , saying: “You don’t have to be rich to be a humanitarian, to help somebody. You don’t have to be famous. You don’t have to be college-educated.” 
Later in the evening during the Parsons gala, Rihanna revealed the winner of the “Design Fellowship Program.” Through the program, three Parsons students will get the chance to work on a fashion merchandise line in Haiti for Rihanna’s Clara Lionel Foundation.

Curtis M. Wong,Gay Dad Plans To Sue United Airlines After Being Accused Of Molesting Son On Flight | HuffPost,"05/25/2017 03:51 pm ET | Updated 1 day ago Gay Dad Plans To Sue United Airlines After Being Accused Of Molesting Son On Flight Henry Amador-Batten said the accusations put his family ""in danger."" By Curtis M. Wong 
A North Carolina man is “devastated” after he says a United Airlines flight attendant accused him of inappropriately touching his son’s genitals. 
Henry Amador-Batten said he and his 5-year-old son, Ben, were greeted at Raleigh–Durham International Airport on Friday by a group of police officers, The Durham Herald-Sun reported . He soon learned that a flight attendant had seen him cuddling with his son on their flight from Newark, New Jersey, and felt that his hand rested too close to the boy’s genitals. 
Amador-Batten, who was returning home from a family visit in Puerto Rico, said he was caught completely off guard by the accusation, but cooperated with police. He said he explained to the officers that Ben was afraid of flying, and he’d simply placed his hand on his son’s lap to comfort him as he fell asleep. Meanwhile, Amador-Batten’s husband, Joel, waited for the pair outside of airport security as the ordeal unfolded. 
In the end, Amador-Batten was not charged with a crime and released. However, he told HuffPost that both he and Ben remain traumatized by the experience. “That flight attendant’s false accusation did not save a child, it put an entire family in danger,” he said. “We’re [made to] understand that families like ours, created out of choice and love, are fragile by nature. ... We are not as protected nor solidified, and we need to be.” 
The case comes at a time when United Airlines has come under heavy media scrutiny for its treatment of passengers. The Chicago-based airline faced backlash in April after a passenger, later identified as David Dao , was filmed being violently dragged off one of their planes in video footage that went viral. 
The company reportedly reached an undisclosed settlement with Dao, but the incident remains “a watershed moment” for the airline, United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz has said. 
In an email sent to HuffPost, a spokesperson said that United Airlines had apologized to the Amador-Batten family. “Our customers should always be treated with the utmost respect,” he wrote. “We have followed up with the customers directly and we apologized for the situation.” 
Amador-Batten acknowledged that he’d received an apology from a United representative, but called it “empty and hollow.” He and his husband, who are in the process of adopting a second son, have hired an attorney and are now planning to seek damages from the airline. The ordeal has been especially difficult for Ben, he said. 
“The most painful part of this continues to be how this affected my son, and how it may continue to,” he said. “He’s not been sleeping well, refusing to sleep in his own room and just wants to be by his daddies.”

Michael McAuliff,Trumpcare Scored So Badly It Could Actually Help The Senate,"05/25/2017 04:19 pm ET | Updated 1 day ago Trumpcare Scored So Badly It Could Actually Help The Senate Some GOP senators are so appalled by the House Obamacare repeal bill that they have little choice but starting fresh. By Michael McAuliff , Sam Stein 
WASHINGTON ― The health care bill crafted and passed by House Republicans received another poor score from the Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday evening, with officials estimating that the legislation would leave 23 million more Americans uninsured by the year 2026. 
But over in the Senate, where lawmakers are trying to create a health care bill of their own, the dismal analysis may actually offer Republican lawmakers a silver lining. Since it does nothing to ease concerns of more than a half-dozen GOP senators, it could encourage them to simply ditch the House plan in favor of a vastly different approach. 
“I like your optimism. I think that’s a very interesting perspective,” said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who has put himself at the center of the main GOP working group trying to come up with a bill, along with the chairmen of the three relevant committees. That group of more than a dozen also includes conservative Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas). 
For weeks now, Republicans senators have been openly critical of having to deal with the House GOP bill. Their worries stem both from the dramatic cuts the House legislation makes to Medicaid expansion, and the insurance market reforms that would result in rising premiums for the elderly and fewer coverage protections for consumers at large. The CBO score, from their vantage point, validated those criticisms. 
“I always said we need to stay focused on one very important goal, and that is reducing costs, premiums,” said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), one of the House bill’s more conservative opponents. Daines said he includes older Americans and ill people among those who need affordable premiums, and according the the CBO analysis, many of those would no longer be able to buy coverage. 
For Portman, the House bill is downright catastrophic in that it would roll back the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid, which is the single largest source of funding to combat the opioid epidemic ravaging his state. He needs to get conservatives like Lee and Cruz off the idea of curtailing that expansion. 
“That’s what I’m trying to do, is shift the discussion a little bit to, how do we continue to provide coverage?” Portman said. Bill Clark via Getty Images 
The reality that the House bill cannot win enough senators’ support at least offers a fresh opening for Portman, even among his conservative colleagues who want to wipe Obamacare entirely from the books. 
“I hope so. I hope so. I just don’t know if we can get the other folks” on the right, Portman said. 
One of the wild-card options boosted by the CBO’s tarnishing of the House bill is a measure written by Republican Sens. Bill Cassidy (La.) and Susan Collins (Maine). 
That legislation is not popular with conservatives, because it keeps the funding sources of Obamacare and lets states that like the Affordable Care Act keep it. But it also ends the hated individual mandate in favor of a system that allows automatic enrollment in insurance with the ability to opt out. How well it would work is debatable . But with the CBO affirming the House bill as a non-starter in the Senate, and Portman struggling to bring his conservative colleagues in his direction, the Cassidy-Collins option could emerge as the de-facto compromise. 
“That’s our hope,” Collins said. “We’ve had several good meetings with our colleagues and there’s a lot of interest, and I believe this does give us momentum to try to draft a different bill.” 
Whether the Senate GOP leadership will follow Collins’ lead is an open question. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said he will only rely on Republican votes, making his margin of error razor thin (he can stand to lose only two members). 
Because of that, lawmakers have had fits coming together on a proposal that would unite senators such as Collins, Portman and Cassidy, with those like Cruz, Lee and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) ― another member of the GOP’s main working group. The CBO score of the House bill makes a fresh approach a necessity. But it doesn’t change the reality and challenges of the whip count. 
The “Senate was already committed to doing its own thing, had a good sense of what the score would say,” said one senior Senate GOP aide. “The challenge for Republicans is that the party doesn’t generally believe in forcing people to buy things they don’t like (and if you haven’t noticed, most healthy young people don’t like super pricey health care plans) and that makes it hard to get a decent CBO score.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST",english,,,,,,,,,,,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOjwIGMdS_.vlEFa2b.JrATDEYv59Tg4VblXHthtcWhY_fHwhTkPqQrtrskkw0u1cWdRfJWRkjRHhg--,Trumpcare Scored So Badly It Could Actually Help The Senate,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/news.xml,The Huffington Post | Full News Feed,2017-05-26T04:19:00.000+03:00,0,1,news,huffingtonpost.com,US,http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/1910_1000/5927334c1600002200ddcdf6.jpeg?cache=5khqlhcqlp,5,
Cole Delbyck,We're Still Waiting For Jennifer Garner The Movie Star,"05/25/2017 04:17 pm ET | Updated 19 hours ago We're Still Waiting For Jennifer Garner The Movie Star She deserves better than playing the silent wife in ""Wakefield."" James Devaney via Getty Images Jennifer Garner signs autographs outside ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."" 
The role of wife and mother is something Jennifer Garner knows well. It’s one she’s played in her last seven consecutive films, an identity that’s boosted her cultural relevance over the past decade, as her on-screen career has taken a back seat to raising a family ... and, err, Ben Affleck . 
Films like “Juno” and “Miracles of Heaven” showed Garner making the most out of the “wife” character, delivering her best film performances to date, exploring the joys and challenges of motherhood. Similar roles in more forgettable fare (”The Odd Life of Timothy Green,” ”Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day” and “Danny Collins”) have fallen by the wayside. And the less said about “Nine Lives” the better. 
Those clamoring for a Garner comeback of a different sort won’t find much to celebrate in “Wakefield,” which opens for a wider release on Friday. Based off the short story by E. L. Doctorow , the film finds Garner playing wife and mother yet again, but the typecasting could be easily forgiven if the material was deserving. Director Robin Swicord, who’s made a career out of bringing women’s stories to the big screen, is at the helm of her first film in years. And yet here these identifiers overwhelm fleeting moments of agency, as Garner’s primary function is to service the evolution of a husband who’s, well, kind of an asshole. 
“Wakefield” belongs to Bryan Cranston as Howard, a man who essentially ghosts his wife Diana (Garner) and children by going on a faux “Into the Wild” quest to find himself. Except instead of traveling all the way to the Alaskan hinterlands, Howard sets up shop in the attic overlooking his house, as he watches his family cope with his disappearance and presumed death. Apart from a handful of flashbacks where Garner gels well with a more adult, edgier tone, her scenes are mostly silent, taking place behind the attic’s glass window pane and through a pair of binoculars. 
There’s a certain boldness in telling this story from the eyes of an unlikable protagonist, especially through the lens of a female director, and no one is better suited than Cranston to humanize an anti-hero. The film stays with Cranston’s character, even in his most arrogant and repulsive moments, as “Wakefield” is a deeply internal piece that strongly evokes its original source material. Exploring everyone’s perverse desire to pull the escape hatch on life is fascinating, but not allowing Garner a moment of respite under Cranston’s unrelenting gaze makes for a frustrating and far less dynamic experience. 
In a recent interview with Build Series, Swicord addressed these criticisms , agreeing that the story is the very “definition of the male gaze,” but claiming that the film ultimately subverts this power structure. There is something to be said about Swicord writing and directing a film that unapologetically empathizes with a middle-aged white male in crisis and not his wife. However, if her intention was to provide commentary on the ways men come to view women, she missed a crucial opportunity in the film’s ending to drive her point home.

While Howard lives in self-imposed destitution, dumpster diving for food and communing with the town’s local raccoon population, Diana is left to her own devices. She later strikes up a romance with Dirk (Jason O’Mara), an ex-boyfriend and former work rival of Howard’s. Through flashbacks, it’s revealed that Howard was only initially interested in Diana because of what amounts to a pissing contest between himself and Dirk. It’s disappointing to say the least that Garner’s character so easily volleys back and forth between the two and is none the wiser. 
Dirk’s encroachment on Howard’s so-called territory and an almost laughable come-to-Jesus moment during a rainstorm prompt him to return home months after disappearing. Before he walks through the door, however, Howard imagines the various reactions Diana and his family might have. In one scenario, they’re terrified, and in another, they break down crying. But before the audience is allowed to see her genuine reaction ― and a scene where she exists outside of her husband’s viewpoint ― the film cuts to black. The short story ends in a similar fashion, so the adaptation is nothing if not faithful, but the ending feels like a cop-out that unfairly robs the character of any semblance of justice. 
Curiously, “Wakefield” was filmed during the nearly one-year period after Garner and then husband Ben Affleck announced their separation . The actor was painted by the media as a philanderer in the midst of a mid-life crisis (see: fake phoenix back tattoo ), while Garner held down the fort, shuttling kids back and forth from karate class. That’s why it’s somewhat baffling that given the material’s fascination with a husband’s failings, Garner chose to work on this project before eventually divorcing Affleck this April .

Laura Barron-Lopez,Some Republicans Blame Liberals And Journalists After GOP Candidate Body-Slams Reporter,"05/25/2017 04:09 pm ET | Updated 14 hours ago Some Republicans Blame Liberals And Journalists After GOP Candidate Body-Slams Reporter Multiple GOP lawmakers said they've thought about attacking reporters themselves from time to time. By Laura Barrón-López 
WASHINGTON ― Apparently, you can body-slam a reporter for asking a question and still have a place in the Republican Party. 
Greg Gianforte, the Republican candidate running for Montana’s open House seat in the state’s special election, was charged with misdemeanor assault late Wednesday after he attacked Ben Jacobs, a reporter for The Guardian who’d gone to Montana to cover the special election there. 
The incident happened the day before the vote, and Gianforte hastily pulled out of previously scheduled interviews on Thursday. Back in Washington, D.C., House representatives leaving a final meeting before a weeklong recess avoided weighing in on the incident by insisting that Montana voters would decide who represents them in the Congress. Others tried to downplay the seriousness of the matter by making jokes about the media’s culpability. Rep. Duncan Hunter said of MT reporter assault, “It’s not appropriate behavior. Unless the reporter deserved it.” — Mary Clare Jalonick (@MCJalonick) May 25, 2017 
Others provided rationalizations for the attack. 
“The actual act of what he did, there’s just no way to justify that,” said Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), who then shifted blame onto liberals. “I understand the frustrations that people feel because we can’t hardly go to a town hall without it just being a total denial of free speech. The left has created enormous polarization in this country.” 
The reaction from elected Republicans to the Gianforte incident reflects the odd, cynical tensions that have come to paralyze some in the Republican Party. Forced to contend with their base’s profound distrust of the press ― along with the fact that their party nominated and helped elect a president who encouraged violence against journalists ― they’ve chosen to soft-foot any shock they may have felt over an actual incident of a reporter being assaulted. 
On Wednesday night, Jacobs was asking Gianfonte about reaction to the latest Congressional Budget Office score for the House-passed bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The Montana Republican “ grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground” before punching the reporter, according to an account published by Fox News reporter Alicia Acuna, who was in the room. 
HuffPost asked nearly a dozen lawmakers about the CBO score on Thursday. No one threw any punches . 
And yet, when asked why Gianforte couldn’t show any such constraint, many of these lawmakers expressed disappointment with the reporters themselves. 
“What’s your question, do I think body slamming reporters is a good thing?” Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) said, laughing at reporters. “Ya’ll really are into this.” 
Some even admitted ― jokingly, one presumes or hopes ― they’ve imagined assaulting a reporter themselves from time to time. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said there’s no excuse for Gianforte’s actions “ as much as we’ve all thought about it.” 
To a large degree, House GOP leadership has their hands tied when it comes to Gianforte. If he wins, they could deny him prime committee positions. But there is little practically that they can do ― should they want to ― to prevent him from being seated. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Gianforte “ should apologize , ” but didn’t go so far as to call on the candidate to withdraw from the race. Others declined to express discomfort with the possibility that their newest colleague will have been so recently charged with assault. 
“We’ll see what the election shows,” Thornberry quipped, when pressed on whether he’s OK with serving alongside Gianforte. 
Out of those who spoke with HuffPost, the harshest comments came from Reps. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) and Tom Cole (R-Okla.). 
“The action is unacceptable, it’s incumbent upon all of us to call an ace and ace,” Sanford said. “Physical violence is not the hallmark of an open society and we can disagree with each other at a visceral and gut level, but you don’t take it to the point of physical contact. He crossed that line.” 
Cole said there’s “no excuse” for what Gianforte did. 
“I suspect it will have electoral consequences,” Cole said. “That’s not the way to get off on the right foot around here.” 
Still, neither Cole nor Sanford said Gianforte should end his campaign. The election will wrap up later Thursday night in Montana.

Sarah Ruiz-Grossman,You Don't Have To March To Be In The Resistance,"05/25/2017 04:06 pm ET | Updated 4 days ago You Don't Have To March To Be In The Resistance Many people with disabilities are joining the fight online. By Sarah Ruiz-Grossman 
In the wave of activism that has swept the country since President Donald Trump’s inauguration, people have found myriad ways of expressing their discontent ― from attending marches and rallies, to making calls to Congress, to showing up at town halls . 
But there’s one form of activism that cannot be swept aside if the resistance is to be truly inclusive, specifically of people with disabilities: online activism. 
While social media is critical to today’s social justice movements , people often dismiss online activism as “ hashtag activism ” or “ slacktivism ,” painting it as less valuable or committed than showing up in person, say, at rallies or marches. 
But often missing from that debate is the perspective of people with disabilities. Disabled people represent 10 percent of the world’s population , and for their community, social media is often a critical way ― at times the only way ― to take part in social movements. 
“I’m a disabled person whose activism is primarily online,” disability activist Alice Wong, who co-started the hashtag #CripTheVote , told HuffPost via email. “Living in a world that is physically and socially inaccessible (e.g., micro-aggressions, lack of transportation, lack of accessible buildings and venues) and living with a body that has significant energy and assistance needs, makes it difficult for me to ‘show up’ the way most activists imagine what ‘showing up’ means .” Alice Wong Alice Wong, founder of the Disability Visibility Project and co-partner in #CripTheVote, research consultant, disability activist based in San Francisco. 
Leading activists and groups in today’s social justice movements can often sideline people with disabilities, likely without even realizing it. 
Last week , for instance, celebrity America Ferrera led a panel, hosted by Twitter and Cosmopolitan as part of her activism group Harness , called #ActivismIRL ― or Activism “In Real Life.” Featuring Women’s March and Black Lives Matter leaders, the panel discussed how to “ turn hashtags into action ” and learn about taking action from so-called “frontline” activists. 
While the panel brought up important points, seeking to teach people who may be new to activism how to engage more deeply in today’s social movements, several people in the disability community also pointed out on Twitter that the event’s #ActivismIRL hashtag seems to draw a false ― and even harmful ― dichotomy between online activism and activism “in real life.” Right now we need every kind of activism & resistance. The notion one is more real is a hoax to divide our power #ActivismIRL #CripTheVote — alice wong (@SFdirewolf) May 19, 2017 @AmericaFerrera For some with disabilities... #ActivismIRL means spreading awareness through social media. I attended a function at the WH via robot! — Dominick Evans (@dominickevans) May 19, 2017 #ActivismIRL is bugging me for reasons beyond the doubleshot of erasure & ableism it applies to online activism of disabled activists. /1 — Gregory Mansfield (@GHMansfield) May 19, 2017 
“Hashtags like #ActivismIRL devalues the labor ― and it’s real labor ― of online activists like myself. We’re present and visible, but in a different way,” Wong told HuffPost. “It’s also pretty ableist when you consider the privilege involved in being ‘in real life.’ Not all people have the ability to travel or the requisite time/resources for frontline activism.” 
Harness, as well as to Ferrera’s public relations team, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Chris Helgren / Reuters 
With the Trump resistance going strong ― April showed a sharp increase in protest activity , and people are getting active online with hashtags like #IAmAPreexistingCondition ― movements are losing out on engaging millions of people when they don’t work to include those with disabilities. 
“I have a progressive neuromuscular disability, and I spent years fighting for equipment that even allows me to get out of bed,” Dominick Evans , media advocate for the Center for Disability Rights, told HuffPost. “I have so much education and information to share with the world, but if I can’t leave my house because my wheelchair doesn’t work, how do I disseminate that?” 
In the current debates around policy, people often think of health care as the critical issue for disabled people. While this is important, t he disability community ― like any community ― is intersectional , including people of all ages, races and religions. That means that issues like education , affordable housing and police brutality can be “disability issues .” 
“The disability community is the canary in the coal mine of public policy: We are usually the first group targeted because of ableist policies that imply that in accessing our rights, we are asking for something extra, which is simply not true ― we are asking for equality,” disability activist and former Obama appointee Rebecca Cokley told HuffPost by email. “ The reality is, we are being impacted, as in the case of Medicaid cuts , increasing funding of vouchers and charter schools , repeal of the protections tied to pre-existing conditions .” Spencer Platt via Getty Images Alba Somoza, who has cerebral palsy, attends a rally with her mother and dozens of health care activists in front of a Harlem charter school before the expected visit of House Speaker Paul Ryan. The activists are critical of Ryan and the passage of the GOP healthcare bill in the House. 
When it comes to responding to political issues with activism, it’s not just those with physical disabilities who can be limited in their ability to participate in person ― so can people with chronic illnesses, mental health issues and other disabilities. 
“I went to my first protest march in Miami on Inauguration Day,” 18-year-old activist Kayla Alamilla told HuffPost in February . “Before then, my depression and anxiety had prevented me from going out and protesting.” 
While today’s leading resistance movements often make an effort to include people with disabilities ― the Women’s March, for instance, had a Disability March website for people to join the Jan. 21 events online, and Black Lives Matter lists disability rights as a priority on its site ― organizations can always do more, according to Wong. 
Valuing and respecting online activism is one part of improving inclusion. Equally important, Wong said, is incorporating people with disabilities in every part of a social movement, from initial planning, to leadership positions, to organizing event access. 
“Almost every group can improve the way they include disabled people in their movements. I’d like to see disabled people present in all movements who are in leadership positions with actual power, not tokens,” Wong said. “Many movement leaders have to be convinced or persuaded to consider disability as diversity when it should be the default.”

Matthew Jacobs,T.J. Miller Is Leaving 'Silicon Valley' After Four Seasons,"T.J. Miller Is Leaving 'Silicon Valley' After Four Seasons On the bright side, ""Veep"" was renewed. By Matthew Jacobs HBO 
HBO has renewed “ Veep ” and “ Silicon Valley ,” but the latter will lose one of its key stars. T.J. Miller, who plays incubator chief Erlich Bachman, isn’t returning after the current season ends. 
HBO released the following statement on Thursday: “The producers of ‘Silicon Valley’ and T.J. Miller have mutually agreed that T.J. will not return for season 5. In Erlich Bachman, T.J. has brought to life an unforgettable character, and while his presence on the show will be missed, we appreciate his contribution and look forward to future collaborations.” 
Without further explanation, it’s reasonable to assume that Miller’s burgeoning film career contributed to his decision to exit the show after four seasons. If so, he’ll find himself in mixed company: George Clooney (”ER”), Shelley Long (”Cheers”), Katherine Heigl (”Grey’s Anatomy”) and Dan Stevens (”Downton Abbey”) are among the actors who’ve abandoned series for big-screen pursuits. After Miller’s HBO stand-up special premieres June 17, he will voice the lead character in “The Emoji Movie.” Next year, he’ll appear in Steven Spielberg’s much-anticipated adaptation of “Ready Player One.” He’s also expected to have a bigger role in the “Deadpool” sequel. 
It’s unclear whether the “Silicon Valley” season finale, which airs June 25, will address Miller’s departure. (”This is all the info we have to share now,” an HBO rep told HuffPost when asked.) The rest of the cast is expected to return to the show, whose overnight ratings have dipped now that “Game of Thrones” isn’t airing as its lead-in.

Matt Fuller,House Republicans Don't Regret Passing Their Health Care Bill,"05/25/2017 04:01 pm ET | Updated 1 hour ago House Republicans Don't Regret Passing Their Health Care Bill The CBO says it would result in 23 million fewer people with health insurance. What's not to love? By Matt Fuller 
WASHINGTON ― House Republicans have finally seen an updated Congressional Budget Office score for the American Health Care Act, and while the legislation reportedly would be disastrous ― 23 million fewer people with insurance over 10 years, plus higher costs for people with pre-existing conditions and women seeking maternity care ― Republicans showed little remorse for passing the bill. 
“I said for weeks I had zero confidence in the CBO,” Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) told HuffPost on Thursday. “You would never hire them to manage your retirement plan, so it came out exactly what I expected it to be.” 
Marshall dismissed concerns that the CBO indicates it would become more difficult for people with pre-existing conditions to purchase insurance in states that waive certain Obamacare regulations and that those people would see their premiums “increase rapidly.” 
“The CBO’s crazy,” Marshall said, adding that sick people would be “even better protected with our legislation than they would before.” 
The report issued Wednesday said the GOP bill would save $119 billion over 10 years, but that savings would come from slashing $834 billion from Medicaid and cutting taxes that were used to fund Obamacare by about $600 billion. The CBO also said low-income seniors, sick people and women seeking maternity care could all face significantly steeper prices, while healthy people in states that waive protections for the vulnerable could see their premiums fall by as much as 30 percent. 
But many Republicans have cast doubt on the CBO, citing the federal agency’s 2010 score for the Affordable Care Act as proof that the scorekeepers can be wrong. Of the more than 20 Republicans HuffPost asked for a reaction, almost all of them shrugged off the CBO report and remained supportive of the bill . 
“The CBO is very good at crunching budget numbers,” Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) said. “It has demonstrated it doesn’t have the first clue about how [health care] markets work.” 
McClintock went on to cite missed Obamacare projections on small premium increases and the number of people who would enroll in the exchanges. (The CBO said there would be around 24 million people electing insurance through the exchanges, while the number ended up being closer to 10 million. And the CBO was off on the number of people who would be helped through Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion: The projection said around 10 million when the number was closer to 14 million.) 
“So their policy discussions are helpful,” McClintock said. “They are often wildly inaccurate.” Bloomberg via Getty Images House Speaker Paul Ryan speaks on Thursday about the Congressional Budget Office's scoring of the GOP's health care legislation and the outlook for raising the U.S. debt ceiling. 
Health policy experts have acknowledged some of the missed projections for Obamacare. But the Commonwealth Fund also said “the CBO’s projections were closer to realized experience than were those of many other prominent forecasters.” And a fact check of how close the CBO projection was for Obamacare concluded that the analysts were not “way, way off.” 
Still, Republicans have a point that the CBO was overly optimistic about the effects of Obamacare. Premiums have gone up, and fewer people have enrolled in the exchanges as a result. And that false optimism in 2010 has led Republicans to conclude that the CBO is overly pessimistic now. 
“CBO has been wrong on so many fronts it ain’t even funny,” Rep. Bill Johnson (R-Ohio) said. 
“There have been so many false assumptions by CBO,” Johnson added. “But what they did verify is that our health care plan ― the American Health Care Plan ― reduces the deficits and lowers premiums.” 
When HuffPost raised the point that the CBO score said the GOP health care bill would not lower premiums for sick people in states that waived protections for people with pre-existing conditions, Johnson said, “Sure it does. I don’t believe them.” 
The CBO also said older people with low incomes would face substantially higher premiums. For example, a 64-year-old making $26,500 a year is expected to pay more than $16,000 a year in premiums for health insurance, even after a tax credit is applied. That same person would pay $1,700 a year in premiums under Obamacare. Tom Williams via Getty Images Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) is among the Republicans who support the American Health Care Act. 
But Republicans said they simply don’t trust the CBO score and generally seemed unconcerned that 23 million people may lose their health insurance. 
Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.), who was on the fence about the bill until the day before the May 4 vote, said 23 million people electing not to buy health insurance as a result of the GOP bill was “basically a picture of when people are not forced to buy broccoli, they don’t eat it.” 
Only Republicans who voted against the health care bill seemed to take the CBO report seriously. 
Vulnerable Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) said she continued to have “a lot of other concerns about the bill.” Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, seemed concerned that other Republicans haven’t addressed how many people are projected to lose insurance as a result of this bill. 
“Too many people are going to be without coverage as a result of legislation that was haphazardly constructed and hastily considered,” Dent said. “And it’s part of the reason why we have an issue here. Too many people are going to be without coverage as a result of legislation that was haphazardly constructed and hastily considered. Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) 
The one Republican who seemed generally upset by some of the CBO’s projections was the man who was instrumental in reviving the bill: Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who chairs the conservative Freedom Caucus. 
Meadows continued to defend the bill after the CBO score was released, pointing to the high-risk pools that states would need to create to waive certain protections for people with preexisting conditions. But after reading a couple of paragraphs about less healthy people facing higher premiums, he began tearing up and talking about what the health care bill meant to him. 
“I lost my sister to breast cancer,” Meadows said Wednesday. “I lost my dad to lung cancer. If anybody is sensitive to pre-existing conditions, it’s me. And I’m not going to make a political decision today that affects somebody’s sister or father, because I wouldn’t do it to myself. And so I tell you that in the most earnest of ways that we’re going to get this right, not just because of my sister and my dad, we’re going to get it right for the American people because that’s the right thing to do.” 
Meadows also suggested that he would be willing to keep more of the Obamacare taxes to help keep more people on Medicaid and to offset the cost of health insurance for sick people. 
“In the end,” Meadows said, “what we’ve got to do is make sure there’s enough funds there to handle pre-existing conditions and drive down premiums. And if we can’t do those [two] things, then we will have failed.” 
Still, Meadows remained supportive of the bill, and his less-than-enthusiastic reaction was the exception, not the norm. 
When HuffPost asked Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) for her take on the CBO score ― which, again, says 23 million fewer people will have insurance, that sick people could face significantly steeper costs, and that women could have to pay around $1,000 a month more for insurance that covers maternity care ― Foxx said, “I think it’s great.” 
House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) expressed relief over the score. Republicans had held onto the bill for two weeks and not sent it to the Senate because they feared it would not save the requisite $2 billion it needed to keep its reconciliation status. 
“I’m actually comforted by the CBO report because it shows, yeah, we’re going to lower premiums,” Ryan said.

Caroline Bologna,Dad's Shares Safety Warning For Parents Whose Kids Play Baseball,"Dad's Shares Safety Warning For Parents Whose Kids Play Baseball “It was one of the scariest moments I ever had with my kids.” By Caroline Bologna 
A Pennsylvania dad’s viral Facebook post is spreading a safety message for parents of young baseball players. 
On May 16, John Curtin posted a photo of his son’s Under Armour heart guard shirt ― a special garment designed to protect athletes from potentially deadly blows to the chest. 
“For all you parents that have children that pitch, do me a favor and run out and buy a heart guard shirt for your child,” Curtin wrote in the caption. “My 11 year old Ryan wears one, and it literally might have saved his life today.” 
The dad described his son’s scary ordeal. “He was pitching and one of the hardest hit line drives came back and hit him straight dead center in the chest and the heart guard absorbed the hit. He was in a lot of pain but a lot better than the alternative.” 
One of Ryan’s coaches, who is an EMT, reportedly told Curtin that if his son hadn’t been wearing the heart guard shirt, the outcome might’ve been a lot worse. 
“It was one of the scariest moments I ever had with my kids,” the dad wrote, adding that he took his son to urgent care for chest X-rays. RichVintage via Getty Images Curtin's post about baseball safety was shared over 94,000 times. 
Curtin’s post has been shared over 94,000 times. He told Scary Mommy that the X-rays came back clear, and Ryan is OK. 
There is debate surrounding the effectiveness of chest protectors in preventing commotio cordis ― a rare but often fatal disruption of the heart’s rhythm due to blunt impact to the chest area. Still, for many parents, the possibility of protection that heart guards promise give them peace of mind. 
“If you want your child to wear one fine, but don’t think that nothing can still happen,” wrote one commenter. 
Added another, “Parenting is about protecting your children from as much as humanly possible, not weighing the odds.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST Recent Recalls Of Baby And Kid Products Recent Recalls Of Baby And Kid Products Recent Recalls Of Baby And Kid Products 1 204 Hobby Lobby Infant Rattles Items recalled : Hobby Lobby recalled its rattles because the seams can separate and exposing the fiber stuffing and bell rattle.Reason: Choking hazard",english,,,,,,,,,,,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOg4_QbAR6p2a53i.PfFS91bDVcL6C47qB9d0ig0zsvUvJRJART3h09FPS5m_qr5I5Rtx2sTYY6UTxBRP.RUv4TzFiX4F_p_.PrXzgWiUHPHbSRnLXSJ39DfYBMLHtdbO.o-,Dad's Shares Safety Warning For Parents Whose Kids Play Baseball,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/verticals/impact/news.xml,Impact News on The Huffington Post,2017-05-26T04:27:00.000+03:00,0,1,news,huffingtonpost.com,US,http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/1910_1000/592739e4200000290016eefc.jpeg?cache=inqo91gfxi,0,
Suzy Strutner,This Device Holds Your Head Up So You Can Nap Hands-Free | HuffPost,"This Device Holds Your Head Up So You Can Nap Hands-Free Not gonna lie, it looks magical. By Suzy Strutner 
One of the most annoying problems with napping on a plane happens when your head lolls about and you can’t find a comfortable and considerate way to prop it up. Inventors have offered up various fixes over the years, from inflatable hoodies to a head hammock , but this solution looks more promising than any we’ve seen in a long time. 
The JetComfy is a cushioned platform for your head that attaches to an armrest and extends to your desired height. While other travel nap gadgets involve blow-up wraps , only support your chin , or require sticking your head into a dark hole , JetComfy takes a more basic approach, says co-founder David Brecht. 
“Our goal was to mimic the natural resting pose of resting your head on your hand,” he told HuffPost. JetComfy 
The JetComfy is a memory foam cushion on an extendable base , which you can slide onto your armrest and clip into place. Adjust the cushion’s tilt to your liking, then nap away. Then retract the base and fold it back up when you’re done. 
At first glance, it looks like this gadget would annoy the heck out of your seat mate because it takes up armrest space. But supporting your head the usual way could be more obnoxious, Brecht suggested. 
“JetComfy takes up only a very tiny portion of the armrest, leaving it available for your neighbor to still use. If you didn’t have a JetComfy, you would be resting your arm on the shared armrest which takes up much more space,” he said. JetComfy 
It’s worth noting it seems people tend to place their arms on the armrest anyway when using the JetComfy, according to photos posted to the company’s Facebook page . Facebook/JetComfy Facebook/JetComfy 
The gadget hit the market late last year and retails for $49.99 on jetcomfy.com and $39.99 on Amazon . It has built-in power packs to charge electronics, too. 
Some reviewers said the JetComfy is too bulky , complained its cushion bumps into their neighbor , and said it doesn’t strap on correctly in aisle seats. Others report no such issues and call it a lifesaver for long flights. 
JetComfy meets TSA carry-on guidelines , so you should be able to bring it onboard with no problem. Whether your seat mate will complain or not is a whole other issue, however: In 2014, a travel gadget called the Knee Defender sparked national debate after causing an in-flight skirmish between passengers when one used it to prevent another from reclining her seat . 
If all else fails, you can always try falling asleep on a plane sans gadgets. Sweet dreams!

Zac Thompson,Teen Vogue Is Evolving Thanks To Elaine Welteroth | HuffPost,"Teen Vogue Is Evolving Thanks To Elaine Welteroth 05/25/2017 04:15 pm ET | Updated 1 day ago 
You may have noticed that Teen Vogue is getting political . At first, this may seem surprising. But to those who have been following the changes at the magazine, it was inevitable. Teen Vogue was recently taken over by a new editor-in-chief committed to making the publication more inclusive and aware of the world we live in. The new E.I.C, Elaine Welteroth, has created an editorial vision that’s expanded and prioritized its coverage of politics, feminism, identity, and activism as it relates to Teen Vogue’s audience . 
This has caused a huge shift for the publication . Teen Vogue’s website has increased by 6.5 million unique visitors since last year when the magazine’s leadership pivoted. Welteroth is just the second person of color at a Conde Nasté subsidiary to hold a E.I.C position, and has more than risen to the challenge. 
Diversity is a key component of her editorial strategy. Young readers are hungry for content that reflects a broad range of experiences, which is something Welteroth undoubtedly built upon from her time on Teen Vogue’s YouTube page hosting a show called “ 3 Steps To. ” 
The new E.I.C may be the youngest in Conde Nasté’s history, but she’s proven that “serious” topics like religion, business, and politics should not be reserved strictly for older generations.

David Moye,Right-Wingers Blast Katy Perry For Daring To Suggest Unity,"05/25/2017 04:29 pm ET Right-Wingers Blast Katy Perry For Daring To Suggest Unity The singer called for “no borders” among pop fans in the wake of the Manchester attack. By David Moye 
Katy Perry’s calls for unity among pop music fans in the aftermath of the Manchester bombing have managed to unite at least one group. 
The problem is that it’s conservative media pundits who are unifying with the aim to score cheap political points by taking the singer’s “border” comments out of context. 
Perry appeared on the Elvis Duran radio show on Z100 in New York on Tuesday morning, expressing her thoughts about the tragedy, which she said left her “devastated.” She told Duran she felt it was time for pop-lovers to put their differences and rivalries aside in times of adversity: 
As much… whatever we say behind people’s backs - because the internet can be a little bit ruthless as far as fanbases go ― but I think the greatest thing we can do is just unite, and love on each other… no barriers, no borders, we all need to just coexist.” 
She emphasized that her comments were directed towards the rivalries that fans often create between each other about different performers, such as Perry’s own feud with Taylor Swift. 
In this case, she urged her fans to support Ariana Grande, whose Monday concert was targeted by a suicide-bomber at the Manchester Arena. The attack left 22 people dead and dozens more injured. 
“Ari’s fans are my fans and my fans are Ari’s fans, and we are all loving on each other and we should just stay loving on each other,” she said, referring to Grande by a nickname. 
But some conservative media personalities immediately attempted to bash her for daring to suggest that there should be no barriers or borders between people. 
Tomi Lahren and others on Wednesday felt obliged to chime in. Hey Katy Perry, question- no barriers no borders right? So how about you walk the streets with no security & live in an ungated community? ?? — Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) May 24, 2017 
Fox News had a field day attacking Perry, inviting conservative firebrand Michelle Malkin to gripe about the singer’s comments. 
“The next time we welcome Muslim refugees from Syria or Yemen into this country, that we should send them to her house ,” she said, according to a video captured by Media Matters, a media watchdog group focused on conservative misinformation. 
InfoWars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones accused Perry of “ shoot[ing] her mouth off about no barriers,” Media Matters reports. 
He also added, for no good reason at all, that Perry has a “big fat pathetic satanic ass.” 
Breitbart was less directly insulting, but tried to claim Perry’s comments were actually directed towards the president, not music fans, saying her “preference for no ‘borders’ or ‘barriers’ may come from her staunch opposition to President Donald Trump .” 
The last part is one thing they didn’t misquote. Perry told Vogue magazine last month that Trump’s election brought up a lot of trauma for her. 
“Misogyny and sexism were in my childhood: I have an issue with suppressive males and not being seen as equal,” Perry said. “I felt like a little kid again being faced with a scary, controlling guy. I wouldn’t really stand for it in my work life, because I have had so much of that in my personal life.”",english,,,,,,,,,,,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOhK7An6JchhIvPFpboYCcrCh0UsFwWQRhubjKtKpveWZ8O4TbQmSLr4zqvidTE_ONJBY9hX_VS4sniQHgbXdnFq,Right-Wingers Blast Katy Perry For Daring To Suggest Unity,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/verticals/politics/index.xml,Politics - The Huffington Post,2017-05-26T04:29:00.000+03:00,0,1,news,huffingtonpost.com,US,http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/1910_1000/59271ee92000003a0016ee96.jpeg?cache=ird1yq3ses,1,
Lilly Workneh,A Man Is Serving 10 Years In Prison Because Of The Crime He Was Acquitted Of,"05/25/2017 04:47 pm ET | Updated 3 hours ago A Man Is Serving 10 Years In Prison Because Of The Crime He Was Acquitted Of Ramad Chatman was originally sentenced to five years probation. Now, he's serving 10 years. By Lilly Workneh 
Ramad Chatman, a black man from Rome Georgia, is serving a 10-year prison sentence after an entire jury found him not guilty of a crime he says he did not commit. 
On May 24, Georgia news station 11 Alive published a report on Chatman’s interactions with the justice system, which began with a first-time offender probation and ends with Chatman serving 10 years in prison ― despite a jury finding him not guilty of a crime he was accused of in between. 
The outlet recounts the story, speaking with family members and legal experts in the video above. 
In July 2014, Chatman was accused of a crime in connection to an armed robbery at a corner store in Georgia. Police say the store was too dirty to collect fingerprints from, and four witnesses who were there that night say all they saw was a “black man in dark clothes,” according to 11 Alive . Camera footage also captured an unidentifiable black man. 
However, it wasn’t until months after the night of the robbery, when the store clerk was scrolling through her Facebook, that she randomly came across a photo of Chatman on her feed. 
“It triggered something in me, and it just made me freak out,” she testified, according to 11 Alive. 
The clerk reported Chatman to the police. He went to the police ― he’d heard they were looking for him. 
“He turned himself in because he knew he was not guilty,” his grandmother Janice Chatman told 11 Alive. 
After Chatman came forward to police in 2015 to rule himself out as a suspect in the corner store robbery, he was arrested for it. 
Chatman had been in trouble with the law once before. He was sentenced to first-offender probation of five years at the age of 19, when he entered a guilty plea for stealing a $120 television. His grandmother said he paid his fines and completed community service. 
When police arrested Chatman in connection with the 2014 corner store robbery, he was still on probation. He faced a hearing to reconsider the terms of the probation, where Superior Court Judge Jack Niedrach decided Chatman did likely rob the store, which legally, was enough for the judge to revoke his original probation. 
Per rules surrounding the first offender status , this meant Chatman was re-sentenced for his original crime. He was ordered to serve 10 years in prison, backdated to his first brush with the law. 
Six months later, a jury found Chatman not guilty of the corner store robbery. They acquitted him of armed robbery and aggravated assault. Despite the verdict, the judge chose not reinstate Chatman’s probation, according to 11 Alive. 
Chatman will remain in prison until 2022 for getting arrested for a crime a jury acquitted him of but a judge thinks he “likely” committed while on probation for an earlier charge. 
The jury’s verdict is unsurprising. There was no certified evidence that Chatman robbed the convenient store. Transcripts from court proceedings, reviewed by 11 Alive, showed that her description of the suspect changed each time she testified. She reportedly misremembered the color of her attacker’s weapon and the clothes he wore, among other things. 
“What would bother most people about this is when people tell stories over and over again, they’re supposed to remain consistent,” Mark Issa, Chatman’s attorney, told the site. 
While Issa expressed sympathy for the emotional trauma the clerk experienced, he said Chatman is not the man responsible for the crime and that her anger was misdirected. In fact, Chatman tried to enter an Alford plea ― which is a guilty plea where the defendant also maintains his innocence ― before the trial began, but it was dismissed and his case went before a jury. 
Ultimately, Chatman is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence for his initial crime of stealing a $120 TV. 
Retired Georgia Supreme Court Chief Justice Norman Fletcher told the Rome News-Tribune last year that Chatman’s case reflects a failing in the legal system that continues to feed into America’s gross issue of incarceration. 
“The law does not always lead to a wise and just conclusion, in my opinion,” Fletcher said. “We can’t afford to continue to lock up more and more people.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST Powerful Black Lives Matter Marches Across America Powerful Black Lives Matter Marches Across America Powerful Black Lives Matter Marches Across America 1 of 28 Protesters gather in Freedom Plaza before a march to the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, DC on Saturday, Dec. 13, 2014.

David Lohr,"After Shaming Pregnant Senior For Months, Christian High School Says She Can't Walk At Graduation","05/25/2017 04:44 pm ET | Updated 12 hours ago After Shaming Pregnant Senior For Months, Christian High School Says She Can't Walk At Graduation The principal says the teen is being punished ""because she was immoral."" By David Lohr 
A Maryland Christian school has barred an 18-year-old senior from walking in next month’s graduation ceremonies because she is pregnant. 
Maddi Runkles, who is a straight-A student, said she became pregnant five months ago. She said she expected some punishment, but also support from officials at the nondenominational Heritage Academy, in Hagerstown. 
“This has been more shame than punishment,” Runkles told HuffPost. 
Runkles said in January, when she and her parents notified the school about her pregnancy, she was immediately dismissed. When her parents appealed the decision, they were told she could come back, but would have to continue her studies at home after spring break. A second appeal from the family resulted in the school’s final decision: removing her from all leadership positions (she was student council president and vice president of the Key Club) and banning her from walking at her graduation ceremony. Students for Life of America Maddi Runkles, who is a straight-A student and five months pregnant, has been barred from participating in her school's graduation ceremonies. 
Heritage Academy’s strict policies require students to sign a pledge in which they agree to protect their bodies by “abstaining from sexual immorality and from the use of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs,” according to the school’s website . 
David Hobbs, administrator at Heritage Academy, addressed recent criticism in a statement released earlier this week. According to Hobbs, Runkles was punished “not because she’s pregnant, but because she was immoral.” 
“Her immorality is the original choice she made that began this situation,” Hobbs wrote. 
Runkles counters that her punishment is much more severe than what’s been doled out to others who have broken the pledge. 
“Sexual morality is not just limited to premarital sex,” she said. “There’s many different forms of it and there have been other kids committing forms of sexual immorality and they have never been treated this harshly.” Students for Life of America ""A bunch of families stood up for us and said, 'This is not right,'"" Maddi Runkles told HuffPost. 
In his statement, Hobbs claims the school wanted to keep the matter private, “to protect: first Maddi, then Heritage.” However, Runkles says Hobbs planned to notify students that she’d broken the rules. She said she didn’t want her classmates to hear it from him, so she volunteered to read a prepared statement to her classmates. 
“It was before my parents and about 70 students ― my whole high school,” Runkles said. “I immediately started crying. I was embarrassed that I had to stand before all my peers and admit what I had done ... When I finished reading it, [Hobbs] got up and read off the punishments he saw fit.” 
The father of her child attended a different school. He graduated last year and is attending college. 
In March, Runkles contacted the pro-life group Students for Life of America . The organization’s president, Kristan Hawkins, said after speaking with the teen and her parents she contacted Hobbs and asked him to reconsider letting the high school senior walk during the graduation ceremony, scheduled for June 2. 
“He basically said, ‘This is a private decision [and] who are you to come in and try to change that,’” Hawkins told HuffPost. 
School administrators have ignored an online campaign supporting Runkles and direct pleas from her parents, Hawkins said. 
Runkles’ father declined to comment Thursday. HuffPost was instead directed to a Facebook post attributed to him. 
“Despite what some may think, Maddi nor her mother and I have ever advocated that she not be disciplined for her actions,” he wrote. “My daughter should be held accountable … but grace and love should be more prominent.” 
The post criticized the school’s decision to wait until the end of the year to fully discipline his daughter, given that her confession had been made months earlier. 
“To the detractors, ask yourself how restoration can take place when you put a student’s punishment at the very end of their high school career,” he wrote. “When do you plan to show Maddi the love and grace that is supposed to take place after discipline.” Students for Life of America Maddi Runkles holding a recent sonogram image. 
According to Hobbs, the school showed Runkles grace by not expelling her. She will still receive her diploma and is still permitted to attend graduation, she just can’t participate. 
“We love Maddi Runkles,” Hobbs said. “The best way to love her right now is to hold her accountable for her immorality that began this situation.” 
But that explanation doesn’t satisfy Runkles. 
“You can’t claim to be pro-life and be against the killing of babies, but then try to toss out the girl who decides to keep her baby just because the situation does not meet your standard,” she said. 
It also doesn’t sit well with her supporters. 
“There’s a lot of young men and women watching this transpire and they’ve set a really awful example,” Hawkins said. “That’s why it’s important for us to make this stupid matter public to show every student this is not acceptable behavior and certainly not acceptable Christian behavior. Hopefully Christian campuses across the country will see this story and re-evaluate how they handle these things.” Related...",english,,,,,,,,,,,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOgoUfl2GI8bzW7uR124z3iB8camVttOltV1.hq0EzrHU_h0WWON7cthjU1vKQabWOWJy9AtmAaxIcUjdgXIbH6SPXT.N1hCfW5dvxFy9VJZpxmmP7AE02mIGCLoIn382jB2bsV1qk1Wt4UUyf5VCff_,"After Shaming Pregnant Senior For Months, Christian High School Says She Can't Walk At Graduation",http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/verticals/politics/index.xml,Politics - The Huffington Post,2017-05-26T04:44:00.000+03:00,0,1,news,huffingtonpost.com,US,http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/1910_1000/5927305d150000210015b6d8.jpeg?cache=lbc9aqlqwg,0,
Ryan J. Reilly,Robert Mueller's Russia-Trump Probe May Force Congress To Pump The Brakes,"05/25/2017 04:24 pm ET Robert Mueller's Russia-Trump Probe May Force Congress To Pump The Brakes The FBI told Rep. Jason Chaffetz he'll have to wait to see former FBI Director James Comey's memos. By Ryan J. Reilly 
WASHINGTON ― Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation of potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government will hold up congressional probes that were looking into whether Trump affiliates colluded with foreign entities to interfere with the 2016 election, a letter from the FBI indicated on Thursday. 
Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, had requested a copy of memos that former FBI Director James Comey reportedly made to memorialize conversations with President Donald Trump . One memo, first reported by The New York Times, allegedly indicated that Trump asked Comey to stop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Comey was fired on May 9 . 
But Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week named Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead the investigation, and the FBI told Chaffetz on Thursday that it couldn’t immediately provide a copy of Comey’s memos. 
“In light of this development and other considerations, we are undertaking appropriate consultation to ensure all relevant interests implicated by your request are properly evaluated,” Gregory Brower, assistant director of the FBI’s Office of Congressional Affairs, wrote in a letter Thursday. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel to lead the investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's associates, but his work may impede ongoing probes in Congress. 
But Chaffetz said in a separate letter on Thursday that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has “its own, Constitutionally-based prerogative to conduct investigations.” While the committee did not want to interfere or impede Mueller’s investigation, Chaffetz wrote, the congressional probe would “complement the work” of the special counsel. 
“Whereas the Special Counsel is conducting a criminal or counterintelligence investigation that will occur largely behind closed doors, the Committee’s work will shed light on matters of high public interest, regardless of whether there is evidence of criminal conduct,” Chaffetz wrote. “The focus of the Committee’s investigation is the independence of the FBI, including conversations between the President and Comey and the process by which Comey was removed from his role as director. The records being withheld are central to those questions, even more so in light of Comey’s decision not to testify before the Committee at this time.” 
Chaffetz’s letter stated that Rosenstein told members of Congress last week that Mueller’s investigation “should not impede the ongoing congressional probes” and that Rosenstein requested congressional investigators coordinate efforts with the Department of Justice. 
Trump has said he had already made up his mind to fire Comey before Rosenstein wrote a memo justifying Comey’s firing for his handling of the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s emails, and Trump said he was thinking of the Russia investigation when he made the decision to fire the FBI director. 
Chaffetz said he is “seeking to better understand Comey’s communications with the White House and Attorney General in such a way that does not implicate the Special Counsel’s work.” Ryan J. Reilly/HuffPost Mueller has established an office at the Patrick Henry Building at Sixth and D streets Northwest in Washington, near the federal courthouse. 
Meanwhile, Mueller has established his office at the Patrick Henry Building at Sixth and D streets Northwest in Washington, a location near D.C.’s federal courthouse that is already home to many Justice Department employees. 
Lee Lofthus, who has served as DOJ’s assistant attorney general for administration since 2006, told reporters earlier this week that Mueller’s office was “up and running,” though its total staff size has not been determined. Lofthus said the special counsel will get its budget from a “permanent, indefinite appropriation” fund. 
“Basically, it doesn’t require us to go up to the Hill with a budget request,” he said. “It basically is an appropriation available if you have something like a special counsel, to make sure that the thing gets funded.” 
Lofthus said DOJ would “make sure that the special counsel gets the money it needs.”

Raymond McNamara was vacationing in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with his cat, Lily, when the unthinkable happened. 
McNamara and Lily were strolling along together on Feb. 11 when suddenly she disappeared near a construction site, according to WSVN TV. Usually, Lily would follow McNamara wherever he went. 
McNamara contacted local authorities who helped search for her, but no one could find her. 
It didn’t help that Lily is blind, deaf and 20 years old. Eventually, McNamara returned home to California, fearing he would never see his cat again. 
Months later, there’s a happier tale: Lily has been found, and she and McNamara were reunited on May 19. 
Amazingly, the cat wasn’t too far from where she had been lost, according to K athy Bieniek of Saving Sage Animal Rescue in Miami, where Lily was taken after being found. 
“She was in the exact same spot where she was lost,” Bieniek told Inside Edition.“She did not move from the spot. She was waiting for her daddy to get her.” Saving Sage Animal Rescue Foundation 
Amazingly, Lily survived Florida heat and rain for two months on her own before being found, but she may have used up a few of her nine lives in the process. 
Not only was her fur terribly matted, but she was also dehydrated and very sick, according to Daniel Rayment of Pet Express Animal Hospital 
“She had some liver issues,” he told ABC News. “We hospitalized her, put her on IV fluids.” 
While Lily was being nursed back to health, McNamara had to drive back cross-country in order to reunite with the companion he thought he’d lost forever. 
The long-awaited reunion happened last Friday. 
Bieniek told Inside Edition that Lily’s personality completely changed when her owner arrived. 
“She’s not a lap cat, but she was finally able to relax,” she said. “All that stress went away. All her worries were lifted off. It was very sweet to see.” 
As for McNamara, he was clearly overjoyed to be back with his beloved friend. 
“She’s never going to get away from me again,” he said.

Hayley Miller,Miss Black Texas Says Police Chief Illegally Arrested Her In Fit Of Racist Road Rage,"05/25/2017 04:47 pm ET | Updated 8 hours ago Miss Black Texas Says Police Chief Illegally Arrested Her In Fit Of Racist Road Rage Carmen Ponder claims the off-duty cop called her a ""black bitch"" and berated her for passing his 14-year-old daughter during a driving lesson. By Hayley Miller Commerce PD/Twitter 
Miss Black Texas 2016 is calling for a North Texas police chief to be removed from his job after he allegedly called her a “black bitch” and unlawfully arrested her for passing his 14-year-old daughter on the road. 
Carmen Ponder, an intern at the Hunt County district attorney’s office and a recent graduate of Texas A&M University, tweeted Tuesday that she experienced “road rage” from Kerry Crews, the police chief in Commerce, Texas. Police brutality and Abuse of Power from a Police Chief. Let me talk to my lawyer and I'll fill y'all in #blacklivesmatter — Carmen Sensei (@CarmenSierraaa) May 22, 2017 
Ponder says she was on her way to a local Walmart when a black truck cut in front of her and began driving erratically. She says she decided to pass the vehicle to avoid a potentially dangerous situation because she believed the driver to be drunk. 
She had parked her car outside the Walmart before realizing the black truck had followed her, she says. Crews, who had not identified himself as a cop, apparently yelled at Ponder for passing his daughter, whom he had been teaching to drive at the time. 
“Whatever, you black bitch,” Crews allegedly told Ponder after she reminded him that it’s “illegal” for a 14-year-old to drive. It’s just a reminder that our skin color ... is seen as something hostile, dangerous and illegal. Lee Merritt, civil rights attorney 
Ponder says she walked away from the confrontation and made her way into the store. She alleges that Crews, his daughter and at least one other man were waiting for her when she returned. 
One of the men allegedly informed Ponder that Crews is a police chief and that she should apologize to him for being disrespectful. Ponder refused and began walking to her car, apparently prompting the man to grab her by the arm and tell her she was going to be detained. 
When more police arrived on the scene, Ponder approached them for help. But she claims the man who initially grabbed her told the officers that she was resisting arrest and instructed them to detain her. 
Ponder was handcuffed, put in the back of the a police car, and detained for roughly 24 hours. She was released but still faces a charge for evading arrest. 
Read Ponder’s description of the ordeal below. — Carmen Sensei (@CarmenSierraaa) May 24, 2017 
Crews did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. He told a local NBC affiliate that his attorneys had advised him not to speak . 
The Commerce Police Department declined to comment on the incident. 
Ponder’s attorney is Lee Merritt, a civil rights lawyer. He told HuffPost that a Walmart employee heard Crews swear at Ponder and apologized on his behalf. Walmart referred HuffPost to the Commerce Police Department when asked for a comment. 
Merritt said Ponder suffered bruising on her arms and is hesitant to leave her house because she’s afraid of being threatened by Crews’ supporters. 
“If this is how [Crews] behaves when he feels someone disrespected him ... how does he handle people who he suspects of committing real crimes?” Merritt said. 
Ponder is calling for the charge against her to be dropped, for Crews to be fired and for the other involved officers to face disciplinary action. 
“It’s just a reminder that our skin color, speaking specifically about the African-American community, is seen as something hostile, dangerous and illegal,” Merritt said. 
Merritt also represented Jacqueline Craig, the black mother from Forth Worth whose arrest went viral after being captured on a cellphone video. A white cop arrested Craig and her two daughters in December after they called the police to report a neighbor for attacking Craig’s 5-year-old son.

Zahara Hill,63-Year-Old Father Receives College Degree With His Son,"63-Year-Old Father Receives College Degree With His Son And they simultaneously became the first in their family to receive college degrees. By Zahara Hill 
At your typical graduation, parents are somewhere beaming in the audience as their kid switches their tassel to the left. But last Friday, 63-year-old Duvinson Jeanty was right alongside his son receiving a bachelor’s degree of his own. 
Duvinson and his 27-year-old son Benjamin both graduated from William Paterson University in New Jersey and are the first in their family to receive college degrees. 
Duvinson, a Haitian immigrant, retired from his 25-year stint as a New Jersey Transit bus driver in 2013 to become a full-time student at the university. 
“It’s always been my dream, my goal to finish college,” Duvinson told CBS New York . Screenshot from InsideEditioncom Duvinson emigrated from Haiti to the U.S. in 1983. 
Like Duvinson, Benjamin didn’t take the straight and narrow path in his pursuit of higher education. After a year at Rutgers University in 2008, he left the school and began working in the fast food industry. Three years later, he realized he wanted to pursue something he felt was more purposeful. 
“I starting making good money, and making money is cool, but how am I serving the community? How am I helping others?” Benjamin told Fox News . 
Part of the inspiration for Benjamin’s change of heart came from witnessing how passionate his dad was about obtaining an education. 
Instead of returning to Rutgers to pursue psychology, Benjamin enrolled at William Paterson, where his dad was already studying finance. “He was my biggest cheerleader and inspiration,” Benjamin told InsideEdition.com . “There were some times I’d come home from work or class late and I’d see him studying and it would encourage me. Seeing him walk across the stage and get his diploma was indescribable.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST 9 Movies That Perfectly Capture The Beauty Of Black Fatherhood 9 9 Movies That Perfectly Capture The Beauty Of Black Fatherhood 1 9 Willie Jones - ""Friday"" In ""Friday,"" John Witherspoon plays Willie Jones, the father of perpetual slacker Craig (Ice Cube).

Sharon Schweitzer,A Primer To Wine Tasting,"A Primer To Wine Tasting 05/24/2017 07:47 pm ET | Updated 4 days ago Pexels 
From France to Italy, and Australia to the USA, wine has become an influential aspect of culture. Surprisingly, the U.S. tops the world in wine consumption, beating France by 2.42 percent and Italy by 5.13 percent . Wine consumption in the U.S. rose to 913 million gallons in 2015, averaging 2.83 gallons per person a year. 
The world of wine is rich with history and subtle techniques for a more enjoyable sipping experience. A quality wine tasting takes preparation, but it’s well worth the effort. For the beginner considering a trip to a local wine tasting room or vineyard, here is your guide to wine tasting National Wine Day, May 25 : Know Your Type - There are many different kinds of wine tastings, each with it’s own atmosphere and decorum. For example, a wine bar will be much more relaxed than a vineyard or a professional tasting room. Decide what experience is preferred before booking. Make a Reservation or Call Ahead - Although most tasting rooms are open weekdays, it is essential to call ahead. They may be booked for a wedding or private event. Avoid Strong Scents- Wine’s aroma is to be savored. Avoid wearing perfume, lipgloss, and heavily scented soap when tasting as it will obscure the body of the wine. Sip Smart - Many patrons choose to spit or pour out excess wine if visiting several wine vineyards in one day. Casual venues, where the focus is more on the fun of the experience and not the education, may advise that drinking a little is fine. Even if you do like the wine, pouring out is acceptable. What all environments have in common is a dislike for inebriated patrons. Eat before arrival and pace yourself. Hydrate, eat, and take a break during the tasting. Wear comfortable, yet fashionable clothes - Layering your outfit will benefit those tasting in microclimates, such as California or other venues close to the ocean and even indoor in the air conditioning. Keep your heels low or choose a pair of comfy flats if the tour includes walking. Opt to carry a crossbody bag or clutch for much-needed accessories, such as glasses/sunglasses, identification, credit card and/or cash for buying and tipping . Try it on for size - Tastings are all about expanding your palate, so even if you aren’t particularly into rosé or reds, keep an open mind. The tasting order is historically whites, reds, and then sweet or “sticky’s”, as each level cancels out the last in boldness. To try a wine again, use the phrase “I would like to revisit…” Stick to the Menu - Ordering off the tasting menu or asking to open a special bottle is inappropriate for regular tasting. If you have a specific year in mind, opt for a private tasting or buy the bottle. Swirl, Sniff, Sip - To optimize a wine’s taste, first swirl the wine in the glass to allow oxygen to open up the flavor. Scent accounts for around 75 percent of what we taste, so don’t be afraid to take a sniff. During tasting it is okay to drink a small sip of the wine, but be considerate and keep it in moderation Cleanse and Hydrate - Hydrate while drinking wine because alcohol dehydrates the body. Sip water between wines to cleanse your palate and stay hydrated. Ask Questions - The tasting experience is educational. The tasting room staff and hosts are trained to educate about the winery they represent, so ask about the vineyard’s history. Discover wine market availability and production techniques

Aspen New Voices Fellowship,New WHO Leader Could Improve Global Health Security By Turning WHO Upside Down,"New WHO Leader Could Improve Global Health Security By Turning WHO Upside Down 05/25/2017 10:19 am ET | Updated 1 day ago Jonathan Torgovnik/Getty Images Reportage KAOLACK, SENEGAL - AUGUST 20: A community health worker providing women in her community counseling and post natal care at her home. 
By Dr. Ngozi Erondu 
A month ago I downloaded all the CVs and applications of the three shortlisted candidates for the new WHO director general. I immediately noted that Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was the only one who directly called out the need to bolster the frail health frontlines of many poor countries. As an infectious disease epidemiologist who works with Ministries of Health in low-income countries and WHO regional offices, I am keenly aware that the leader of WHO will have a huge impact on my partners and my work. 
In light of an impending pandemic of all pandemics , the world needs this bold and precise assessment of the global health system. We need to strengthen local (i.e., in-country) capabilities to detect and respond to potential health events that have mass consequences—diseases ranging from SARS to cholera. As the former Ethiopian Minister of Health, Dr. Tedros has first-hand knowledge of how communities are integral to detecting outbreaks earlier and executing health initiatives. Ethiopia has one of the best and most progressive community health programs; the now famous all-female “army” of health workers was developed under the strong direction from then Minister Tedros. 
The value of this pioneering insight and championing of community health workers is priceless. We know from recent pandemics that when global entities merely ship in foreign experts to address local emergencies, communities can resist, foreign workers can exacerbate the problem, and severe consequences can arise. For example, during the Ebola outbreak in 2014, fearful residents in Guinea attacked and killed a delegation of health workers and journalists. Late last year, the U.N. finally apologized for its role in Haiti’s 2010 cholera outbreak—a disease that had been eradicated from the country and was brought by foreign aid workers who failed to follow protocols when disposing of wastewater. Dr. Tedros’ appreciation for local capacity could shift the current dynamic in response measures and avoid these types of clashes. 
Dr. Tedros’ hard-won wisdom of the inner workings of a ministry of health is an advantage that his two competitors lacked. His ability to anticipate the challenges and needs that national health programs would face in providing and maintaining health services and public health systems will be useful in leading the WHO. With a Ph.D. in community health, Dr. Tedros brings a fresh perspective to a large and sometimes unwieldy organization. I’m hopeful that the WHO under his leadership will embrace local led initiatives and foster public-private collaborations to meet the health needs of all people. The same man who revolutionized health care in Ethiopia by creating a grassroots, para-medical cadre of all-female community health workers wins my confidence as the best-positioned to stop another outbreak in its tracks. 
Dr. Tedros steps into a WHO that must undergo significant reforms in order to define its role in coordinating global responses during health emergencies. To do this, WHO must work before times of crises to restore its authority in coordinating and directing these multi-institutional partnerships. Though this is no easy task, it seems that Dr. Tedros embraces these challenges and his experience in leading other multilateral organizations suggests he can help make the WHO leaner and less bureaucratic, and thus a more responsive organization connected to the realities on the ground. In addition, he brings the experience of reforming Ethiopia’s resource-constrained health system and proficiency in diplomacy ― key skills that are critical for the director general position. 
Considering WHO’s reputation has been damaged as a result of its inadequate response to the Ebola outbreak and the continued indictments about poor management of donor funds, Dr. Tedros has a mammoth job ahead of him. Dr Tedros also enters the post under some controversy ; his alleged reluctance while health minister of Ethiopia to declare cholera epidemics during his tenure is a contentious point that some critics cite as a case against him. If he is vocal about shunning this practice and remains transparent going forward, he should be able to overcome this and work effectively with country governments. 
Finally, not unlike President Obama, Dr. Tedros must carry the added hefty mantle of hope and scrutiny that comes with being the first African director general. He steps into a precarious world of populism, corruption, and insulation—can he present himself as a change agent that others will embrace? My fingers (and toes) are crossed—perhaps this election signifies that he is exactly what WHO needs for such a time as this. After I read through the three CVs several weeks ago, it was Dr. Tedros who had earned my vote— if I had one to submit. A lot is resting on the hope that World Health Assembly and I got it right.

Emily McCombs,What This Dad Realized When He Patted Himself On The Back For 'Helping',"What This Dad Realized When He Patted Himself On The Back For 'Helping' ""If you find yourself thinking this way, fix it right away."" By Emily McCombs Mike Reynolds Mike Reynolds posted on Facebook about a moment of realization he had while making lunches for his kids. 
Recently, a comic went viral entitled “ You Should’ve Asked ,” that sought to explain in simple terms (and pictures) the systemic inequality in the distribution of household labor between men and women. Reading the comic seemed to serve as an a-ha moment for many women that put words to their experience. 
It’s the same topic being addressed by one dad who’s trying to send the message to other men that doing your share of the work isn’t “helping out.” 
Dad and HuffPost blogger Mike Reynolds , also known as Everyday Girl Dad , posted on Facebook about a moment of realization he had while making lunches for his kids, when he thought of himself as giving his wife a “break.” 
“Truth be told, I probably make lunches the most often in our house because my brain wakes me up early,” he wrote. “But the simple fact that I thought of making lunches as ‘helping’ reminded me of how unfairly labour can be distributed in the household. Imagine the privilege, or lack of understanding, to be able to refer to doing work around the house as ‘helping.’” 
He went on to remind himself, and other fathers who might be reading, that doing domestic chores and childcare tasks are just part of your job as a parent and adult member of the household. 
“Making lunches, washing dishes, sweeping up dirt, folding laundry, picking up LEGO, signing tests, writing book order cheques, remembering it’s hot lunch day, getting money for popcorn day, feeding the cat, cleaning the kitty litter isn’t ‘helping out,’ it’s ‘equitably splitting labour,’” he writes. Mike Reynolds Reynolds is the father to two daughters, 5-year-old Charlotte and 7-year-old Leah. 
Reynolds is the father to two daughters, 5-year-old Charlotte and 7-year-old Leah. Reynolds told HuffPost he tries to talk about the division of labor as often as he can because he wants his daughters to grow up knowing there are no prescribed roles for them just based on their gender. 
“I’m not an expert, I am just a guy who makes mistakes, but wants to use those mistakes to get better at being a partner and a parent,” Reynolds told HuffPost. “I think messages like this coming from an average guy like me makes it easier to understand how this same thing can be happening in other families.” 
Reynolds has also created a line of T-shirts and sweatshirts featuring phrases that fight stereotypes about masculinity and fatherhood. The slogans on the shirts include, “Dads for daughters dating...and other choices they make for themselves” and “Not my body, not my choice.” 
Reynolds suggests in his Facebook posts that men should be careful not to pat themselves on the back for “helping,” that they check their own privilege regularly, and that they talk about these issues with their partners. 
More than anything, he tells HuffPost he suggests listening to women. 
“There is so much information out there about emotional labor, gender roles in the family, and the ways we can change this that it is really easy to figure out that this is a very real thing. I really think there is no better way to learn about this, though, than by listening to women talk about how these things show up in their lives.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST Emily McCombs Parents Editorial Director, HuffPost MORE:",english,,,,,,,,,,,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOgD2dmrqazc2nEWubElo1qm_5QsxipG6_iMK8dfvAYXM0kztab7Gsm_cKi63cwyCykPuAoMEPZql4bKDCwPAw22pdNyTz7aaco2mz.xhyu2Y3zP2CFFupjysh8GkQK1ve_IQtxgQaxM4A--,What This Dad Realized When He Patted Himself On The Back For 'Helping',http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/verticals/parents/index.xml,Parents - The Huffington Post,2017-05-26T05:06:00.000+03:00,0,1,news,huffingtonpost.com,US,http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/1910_1000/59273ab61600002100ddce19.jpeg,0,
Chelsea Clinton,"To Nurture Compassionate Children, Start At Birth","To Nurture Compassionate Children, Start At Birth Children’s earliest experiences meaningfully shape who they are. 05/25/2017 05:20 pm ET Rawpixel via Getty Images 
Parents, caregivers and teachers often focus on teaching children to speak, to read and even to play. We also need to focus on helping to build children’s capacity for compassion, empathy and constructive experiences with others. These are called social-emotional skills, and they are vital to children’s success in school and life. Thankfully, every adult in children’s lives can help them build these skills – right from the start. 
Children’s earliest experiences meaningfully shape who they are. From the moment they’re born, parents and caregivers can help children build a strong social-emotional foundation through their nurturing and loving relationships, including through their everyday routines and moments when they talk, read and sing together. All learning is interconnected, and the earlier we start, the better off all children will be. 
A new report from Too Small to Fail highlights how critical early social-emotional experiences, starting from birth, are to all aspects of a child’s development. Researchers have found when parents and caregivers talk about their babies’ experiences and what they’re feeling with them in nurturing and supportive ways, we strengthen their ability not only to learn, but also to recognize and understand their feelings and actions, and how these affect others. We also help them develop their ability to express thoughts, communicate feelings, and demonstrate positive behaviors which will go a long way toward helping children develop into compassionate and confident adults. Fostering creativity and imagination also helps children with their social-emotional development. 
Children with strong social-emotional skills are more interested in all types of learning and do better later in school because they are more focused, more open to cooperation, and have fewer behavioral problems. Social-emotional development also helps foster a child’s ability to plan, manage emotions and persist at tasks. This leads to greater math proficiency, better reading ability and more sophisticated reasoning skills. 
And finally, children with a strong social-emotional foundation are more likely to experience a smoother transition into adulthood. In 2015, researchers found that children entering kindergarten with better social-emotional skills were more likely to graduate high school on time, complete a college degree, and maintain full employment by age 25. These children also had lower rates of smoking, drug dependence, teen pregnancy, involvement with the police, or dependence on public housing. Building these skills early in life is an economic imperative. Recent estimates show a high return on investment for school programs that promote the development of social-emotional skills: for every $1 invested in these programs, $11 is returned to society. 
The data are clear, yet as a society we are not supporting parents and caregivers to be able to have the time with their children in order to help them build these skills. This is one reason why paid family leave and flexible work policies really matter. And while they are at work, parents need affordable, high-quality childcare that ensures their children will experience these skill building interactions all day long. Parents also need tools, information, and resources to make the most of everyday moments – starting today. 
That’s why the Clinton Foundation’s and Opportunity Institute’s Too Small to Fail initiative focuses on the importance of talking, reading, and singing with babies to boost brain development and help build language, early literacy, math and social emotional skills. It provides free and easily accessible information, including new resources to help guide families through different stages of parenting. These are designed to help them better understand their children’s behavior, set limits with love and build all of the skills their children will need to carry them through school and life. 
We all must do everything we can to help our children grow up equipped to navigate our world’s increasing complexity with compassion, empathy and competence. Nurturing these qualities in the next generation is a shared responsibility, and the sooner we start the better off we’ll be.

Dr. Gail Gross,Tips For Preventing Summer Learning Loss,"Tips For Preventing Summer Learning Loss 05/25/2017 11:44 am ET | Updated 2 days ago 
Two words can help you prevent learning loss this summer: enrichment & involvement. Academic delay that occurs over the summer is one of the greatest problems confronting teachers each fall. In fact, when your children return to school, they may have experienced such learning loss during the summer, that they will need to spend several weeks catching up to where they once were academically. 
If you stay involved and vigilant for those teachable moments over summer vacation, you can bond with your children, get to know them better, and have a lot of fun learning together. 
When my children were young, I was a teacher, so I used the old lesson plan approach to summer activities. We took trips to the art museum, history museum, science museum, NASA, and took every opportunity to practice and rehearse math skills, science skills, history, geography, and all matters of curriculum, in the most relaxed and painless way. 
Challenge yourself this summer by deciding to enrich your children so that they can return to school in the fall without having lost any academic ground. Here are a few tips that worked for me: Visit your local library. A family trip to the library is a wonderful source for many activities. This includes taking turns reading to one another, sharing interests, and opportunities for you and your child to write and discuss your choices of reading material. You can also record stories that you and your children create for one another, to be played back at bedtime or by a babysitter when you have a date night. Go on field trips. Field trips to art museums, science museums, and history museums, open up all kinds of activities that are related to history, math, science, geography, and social studies. Not only do your children benefit from mutual discussions about your field trips, but also from reading, drawing pictures, and writing stories about what interested them about their excursions. You can link a trip to a particular museum to the library, to find books that relate to the museum exhibitions. Then there are trips to ice cream factories, cheese factories, bakeries, farmer’s markets, arboretums, zoos, historical sites -- all of which provide learning opportunities. Discuss with your children the measurements needed for baking and making ice cream and cheese, topics of history sites visited, and so on. Travel the world without leaving home. Geography was a big hit at our house. My family spent many hours looking at an atlas that we checked out at the library. The atlas is a great source of maps, color photos, and explanations of resources found at particular locations. You can also hang a map in your children’s room and using colored tacks, track the course of a friend’s, family member’s, or famous person’s trip across the globe. My family even planned dinner around a particular country, using the atlas to tell us what products could be found in that country, and cookbooks to help us find native recipes. This is not only a lot of fun but also a great learning tool, as the mind remembers what is accompanied by the senses, especially sight, smell, touch, taste, and the joy of creating. Encourage your children to connect with other children. Having a pen pal or a book club over the summer is a free and fabulous way of engaging reading and writing, English, and literature. Cook with your children. Cooking is a great way to teach about measurements and how to use fractions. Theme nights for dinner not only teach cooking skills, but math, as you teach your child how to measure and convert weights, volumes, and numbers. Using an historical cookbook for a taste of history can help you and your family re-enact events important to our past. History will be remembered when linked to a delicious meal, including an historical dessert. Play school with your children. Let your child take turns being the teacher, with other children or with yourself. Include the creation of lesson plans, colorful pencils, and workbooks. Get into the act with the whole family. Putting on family plays, writing scripts, rehearsing and memorizing parts, can help your child not only learn about writing and organization, but also about performing. Try musicals, which can tap into your child’s musical talents and skills, while all along building self-esteem. Spell F-U-N with family game nights. Family game night including Hedbanz, Apples to Apples, Scrabble, or crossword puzzles, is a great way for your child to polish up on spelling. And simply enlarging your summer-time vocabulary daily will increase your child’s. Teach about money, stocks, and bonds. Use the newspaper or financial apps as a teaching tool. This is an interesting and fun way to engage your children in math. Your kids will love it, because they will feel grown up, imitating you. Send your kids –and yourself! – to camp. If your child is lucky enough to be able to go to camp over the summer, they may enjoy a camp that focuses on their interests. For example, science camps and writing camps are interest-based. If you can’t afford a camp, you still have access to free and available day camp activities in your town or city. For example, performing arts centers, parks and recreation departments, various museums, and outdoor theaters often offer free day programs in the arts, nature, and sports. Take family vacations – real or virtual. Family trips to historic places like Williamsburg, Valley Forge, or The Liberty Bell, are fun vacations that include the re-enactments of important moments in history, and are so exciting. If you can’t afford family trips, you can plan for a future trip, and supervise the use of the internet to create a virtual vacation. Remember, you don’t have to travel far or spend a lot of money: every town has its own historical sites that you can take advantage of, right there at home. Establish chores with a purpose. Small chores around the house can give your children the opportunity to save money, to count money, and to plan for something special that they need their math skills to accomplish. Supervised math, science, geography, history, and spelling games on the internet can be saved as a reward for a job well done. Chores can provide so many lessons: responsibility, obligation, commitment, as well as curriculum. 
Summer fun can be filled with the enriching learning experiences that children need to prepare them for school in the fall. And, summertime is an ideal relaxed environment that gives your children a chance for independent learning. There are so many more things you can find to do with your children; this list is just a start. Be creative, be engaged, and most importantly, have family fun in the sun!

Carolina Moreno,The 'Despacito' Lyric Guide That Every Non-Spanish Speaker Needs,"The 'Despacito' Lyric Guide That Every Non-Spanish Speaker Needs We're looking at you, Bieber. ?? By Carolina Moreno 
Luis Fonsi’s “Despacito” became the No. 1 song in the country last week, a feat that hasn’t been achieved by a Spanish-language song since the “Macarena” in 1996. 
The hit’s original version features reggeaton superstar Daddy Yankee. But in April, Justin Bieber decided to join the worldwide phenomenon and collaborated on a remix that quickly climbed the U.S. charts. 
Bieber sings in Spanish for the first time on the track, and Fonsi said the Canadian artist learned the lyrics phonetically in less than a week. The Spanish lyrics didn’t seem to stick, however, as the singer appeared to forget all the words to the song during a New York City club performance on Tuesday. 
We get it, “Despacito” can be challenging for non-Spanish speakers. That’s why HuffPost Latino Voices is giving English-speaking fans a quick lyric guide. 
Here’s a rough translation of what the No. 1 song in the country is actually talking about. And yes, we’re using the lyrics from the original version . “Despacito” or “Slowly” Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote, Tengo que bailar contigo hoy. Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome, Muéstrame el camino que yo voy. Yes, you know I’ve been looking at you for a while, I have to dance with you today. I saw that your look was already calling me, show me the way and I’ll go. ¡Oh! Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal. Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan, sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso. Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal.Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más,Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro. Oh! You, you’re the magnet and I’m the metal. I’m getting closer and coming up with a plan, just thinking about it accelerates my pulse. I’m already enjoying it more than normal. All of my senses are asking for more, this has to be done without a hurry. [Chorus] Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito. Deja que te diga cosas al oído, para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo. Despacito Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito. Firmar en las paredes de tu laberinto y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo Que le enseñes a mi boca, t us lugares favoritos. Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro, hasta provocar tus gritos y que olvides tu apellido [Chorus] I want to breathe your neck slowly. Let me whisper things in your ear, that you’ll remember when you’re not with me. Slowly I want to undress you with kisses slowly. Sign the walls of your labyrinth and turn your body into a manuscript. I want to see your hair dance, I want to be your rhythm I want you to show my mouth your favorite places. Let me surpass your danger zone, until it makes you scream and makes you forget your last name. Daddy Yankee: Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo. Yo sé que estás pensándolo. Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo. Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam-bam. Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bam-bam. Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe. Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe. Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje. Empezamos lento, después salvaje. Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito. Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito. Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza veo que eres malicia con delicadeza. Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito. Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito. Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas, pero pa’ montarlo aquí tengo la pieza. ¡Oye! If I ask you for a kiss, come on, give it to me. I know you’re thinking about it. I’ve spent a while trying, mami, this is give and giving. You know your heart with me goes bam-bam. You know what this babe wants from me is bam-bam. Come, taste my mouth to see how it tastes to you. I want, want, want to see how much love fits in you. I’m in no rush, I want to take the ride. We’ll start slow and then go wild. Step by step, gentle gently. We’ll get closer, little by little. When you kiss me with that skill, I see that you are malice with finesse. Step by step, gentle gently. We’ll get closer, little by little. This beauty is a puzzle, but to put it together I have the piece.

Igor Bobic,Leaders Of Senate Russia Probe Given 'Blanket Authority' To Issue Subpoenas,"Leaders Of Senate Russia Probe Given 'Blanket Authority' To Issue Subpoenas The investigation is gaining some steam. By Igor Bobic 
WASHINGTON ― The Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to give its leaders “blanket authority” to issue any subpoena they deem appropriate in their investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. election and possible ties between Moscow and President Donald Trump ’s campaign. 
Under regular committee rules, Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and ranking member Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) could only issue subpoenas after a full committee vote on the matter. Thursday’s vote, however, allows the two leaders to act jointly without the approval of their fellow members ― thus speeding up the process. 
On Wednesday, the committee issued two new subpoenas specifically targeting former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s businesses, Flynn Intel LLC and Flynn Intel Inc. 
Flynn was fired earlier this year over failing to disclose that he had had conversations with Russian officials prior to Trump’s inauguration. 
Burr and Warner maintained that Flynn’s decision to assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination does not apply to his businesses and documents, adding he could be subject to a contempt charge if he doesn’t turn over the materials. 
“We would like to hear from Gen. Flynn,” Burr told reporters on Wednesday. “We’d like to see his documents. We’d like him to tell his story because he publicly said, ‘I’ve got a story to tell.’ We’re allowing him that opportunity.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.

Lee Speigel,Giant 'Styrofoam' Planet Could Help Scientists Find New Habitable Worlds,"05/25/2017 05:13 pm ET | Updated 3 days ago Giant 'Styrofoam' Planet Could Help Scientists Find New Habitable Worlds The huge, ""puffy"" planet has the same density as styrofoam. By Lee Speigel 
We’re all pretty familiar with objects made from styrofoam. Our daily lives intersect with disposable items like coffee cups, insulation, hot and cold coolers and those seemingly millions of little cushioning styrofoam-y “things” that are put into mailing boxes to protect the more valuable contents. 
And styrofoam balls are often used in arts and crafts to create models of the planets for hanging mobiles in bedrooms, classrooms and museums around the world. Left: Saurbh R Patil/Wikimedia Commons / Right: Marc Dantonio/FX Models While scientists investigate a recently discovered styrofoam ""puffy planet,"" styrofoam balls (left: Saurabh R. Patil/Wikimedia Commons) are enormously popular in the creation of the planets of our solar system (right: Marc Dantonio/FX Models) 
But, now, who would’ve guessed? Researchers at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, recently discovered a planet approximately 320 light-years from Earth that, according to a university statement , “has the density of styrofoam.” 
And the planet could be useful for scientists looking to discover new habitable worlds. 
“This ‘puffy planet’ outside our solar system may hold opportunities for testing atmospheres that will be useful when assessing future planets for signs of life,” the statement said. 
A global effort of university researchers, observatories and amateur astronomers resulted in an online paper published in The Astronomical Journal . The paper describes initial findings of the planet dubbed KELT-11b, which orbits the bright, subgiant star, KELT-11. 
“It is highly inflated, so that while it’s only a fifth as massive as Jupiter, it is nearly 40 percent larger, making it about as dense as styrofoam, with an extraordinarily large atmosphere,” said Lehigh University astronomer and team leader Joshua Pepper . 
But it’s not just the styrofoam-like similarity of the planet that intrigues scientists. The star ― KELT-11 ― that KELT-11b orbits plays an important role. The star is so bright, as seen from Earth’s southern hemisphere, that it can shed light ― literally ― on KELT-11b’s atmosphere. The high brightness of the star shining through the atmosphere of the planet allows Earth-based equipment to better observe the planet’s atmosphere. 
“That’s a process called transmission spectroscopy , where we measure the atmosphere by measuring the light of the star that gets filtered through the outer layers of the planet’s atmosphere,” Pepper told HuffPost. 
“The planet goes in front of the star and a little bit of the light from the star passes through it. The atmosphere imprints on that light certain color patterns that are associated with the material in the atmosphere. Whether there’s oxygen, or carbon dioxide, methane or ammonia, you can actually see those patterns, even if we can’t see the planet itself.” 
This, in turn, gives astronomers the ability to develop new tools to help them determine if Earth-like planets are surrounded by atmospheres that might allow life to evolve. 
KELT stands for Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope , referring to two small robotic telescopes ― one in Arizona and one in South Africa, both built by Pepper ― that scan the night sky, taking measurements of 5 million stars. Those who monitor the data searching for possible planets are looking for the type of star that becomes dimmer at regular times. This might indicate the presence and movement of a planet crossing the star, producing an eclipse effect. Photo courtesy of Joshua Pepper The KELT-South robotic telescope in South Africa that made the discovery of KELT-11b. 
If researchers want to learn more about KELT-11b, they’d better hurry. 
Well, sort of. 
The “styrofoam” giant is so close to its parent sun that it takes less than five days to orbit KELT-11. KELT-11 has begun depleting its nuclear fuel as it evolves into a red giant, and at this rate, it will eventually envelop its puffy partner within the next 100 million years. 
The Lehigh research team says the KELT discovery will prove to be an important target to learn more about how atmospheres are formed in the search for habitable worlds.

Arthur Delaney,"Contra Mick Mulvaney, People Know Disability Is Part Of Social Security","05/25/2017 05:08 pm ET Contra Mick Mulvaney, People Know Disability Is Part Of Social Security Trump's budget director makes a tricky claim to argue proposed Social Security budget cuts don't break campaign promises. By Arthur Delaney , Daniel Marans 
WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump ’s budget chief said repeatedly this week that when people think of Social Security, retirement insurance is the only thing that comes to mind ― not disability insurance. 
A “welfare program for the long-term disabled,” Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said on Tuesday, “is not what most people would consider to be Social Security.” 
Social Security is best known as retirement insurance, but plenty of people are aware that it’s also disability insurance. Forty-three percent of survey respondents said they knew someone who received disability or survivors’ benefits from Social Security, according to a 2010 poll by AARP . (Asked if they knew someone simply “on Social Security,” more than two-thirds said they did.) 
Mulvaney insisted disability insurance shouldn’t count as Social Security because President Donald Trump promised during the campaign that he would never support cutting Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. Trump’s budget, which Mulvaney unveiled this week, breaks that promise by proposing cuts to both Medicaid and Social Security. Because it doesn’t target Social Security’s retirement insurance component, Mulvaney dubiously claims the proposal doesn’t break Trump’s promise. 
“If you ask 999 people out of 1,000, [they] would tell you that Social Security disability is not part of Social Security,” Mulvaney said on Monday. “It’s old-age retirement that they think of when they think of Social Security.” 
If 43 percent of Americans have heard of Social Security Disability Insurance, per the AARP poll, then that means Mulvaney’s assertion is not correct. Aaron Bernstein / Reuters White House budget director Mick Mulvaney did his best to claim that Donald Trump's proposed cuts to Social Security Disability Insurance do not violate his campaign promises. 
And, as the progressive think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes , even Republicans amenable to cutting Social Security Disability Insurance have talked about the program as a basic part of Social Security. 
“Social Security provides vital financial support for more than 57 million beneficiaries,” House Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-Wis.) congressional website says . “Social Security also provides critical benefits to widows and those with disabilities.” 
As a teenager, Ryan and his mother received Social Security survivors’ benefits after his father’s death, another element of the program that Mulvaney’s narrower definition of Social Security excludes. 
Getting the benefits “helped me pay for college, it helped her go back to college in her 50s where she started a small business because of the new skills she got,” Ryan recalled during the 2012 vice presidential debate . 
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has also discussed the importance of Social Security survivors’ benefits for his younger sister, when both their parents died in a short span of time. 
And Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Texas), chairman of the Social Security subcommittee on the House Ways and Means Committee, has spoken about the program as a crucial source of insurance in the event of a severe disability. 
“For years I’ve talked about the need to fix Social Security so that our children and grandchildren can count on it to be there for them, just like it’s there for today’s seniors and individuals with disabilities,” Johnson said in December . 
In fact, it was a Republican who first created the Social Security Disability Insurance program. President Dwight D. Eisenhower expanded Social Security to cover workers with disabilities and their dependents in 1956. From that point on, Social Security became known as the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance program. 
The disability benefits part of Social Security was a natural extension of the program’s mission to enable workers to contribute toward a fund that would provide them income for times when they are no longer capable of working. Disability benefits, like Social Security retirement benefits, are based on a certain percentage of a worker’s previous earnings, rather than need, like some means-tested welfare programs. 
Some policy experts who helped conceive of Social Security in the 1930s favored making disability benefits part of the original program, according to a history on the Social Security Administration website . They were overruled by colleagues concerned about the cost of adding those benefits, and critics in the private disability insurance industry, delaying its passage for an additional two decades.

OpenSecrets Blog,"Next Election Is Still 18 Months Away, But It’s Never Too Early To Collect Cash","United States Close Next Election Is Still 18 Months Away, But It’s Never Too Early To Collect Cash 05/25/2017 03:26 pm ET | Updated 7 hours ago (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) (CQ Roll Call via AP Images) Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller collected more cash from his colleagues in the first three months of the 2018 cycle than any other incumbent who’s considered vulnerable. 
by Sara Swann 
Even with the 2018 midterm elections still 18 months away, both Republicans and Democrats are making moves to strengthen their most vulnerable incumbents. 
One way they’re doing it: By contributing through their candidate committees and leadership PACs. Already, more than $3 million changed hands this way in the first three months of 2017 — nearly $2.6 million in the House and $769,000 in the Senate. 
These are the 2018 candidates who are the top recipients of funds from their colleagues: 
All of these candidates in some way have been pinpointed as vulnerable. In the House, all eight of the Republicans listed above are “ Round One ” targets for the Dems, and are also in the Patriot Program, organized by the National Republican Congressional Committee to support candidates facing particularly challenging elections. The two Democrats have been added to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s similar Frontline Program. 
Currently the GOP holds the majority in the House by a wide margin — 241 seats to the Democrats’ 194. Thirty-four seats in the Senate will be on the ballot. But the president’s party usually loses seats in Congress in the midterm elections. 
To gain a majority in the Senate, the Democrats will have to cling to its 25 seats that are up for re-election and fight for three more. (Two of the 25 are held by Independents who caucus with the Democrats.) Republicans, meanwhile, have their eyes on a 60-seat supermajority so they can block Democratic filibusters (that’s if filibuster rules still exist by 2019). To get there, they would need eight more seats and couldn’t lose any of their nine incumbents up for re-election. 
While the Democrats’ goal in the Senate might be gettable, winning the House would be a reach, said Laurel Harbridge Yong, an associate professor of political science at Northwestern University. That’s partly due to a “bad map,” she noted: Where people live across the country and how they’re divided up into House districts in general leans more in favor of Republicans, she said, and that’s not just from gerrymandering; it also has to do with the fact that a lot of Democratic voters are concentrated in cities, rather than spread out in rural areas like GOP voters often are. 
“The tricky thing is what are the Republicans going to accomplish between now and the election?” Harbridge Yong said. “They probably aren’t going to get a lot done due to in-party fighting, in which case the Democrats can say, ‘you had control and you didn’t do anything.'” 
The most vulnerable candidates in the upcoming election, Harbridge Yong said, are the people whose partisanship doesn’t align with how their state voted in the 2016 presidential election. 
Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), the lawmaker who has received the most funding so far from his colleagues, is looking at what’s expected to be one of the most difficult races in 2018. He is the only Republican senator up for re-election in a state that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. This makes him one of the primary targets for the Democrats, who are desperately reaching for the Senate majority. 
Twelve different politicians have contributed to Heller’s campaign so far to give him his $79,000 total. His top four supporters are Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) and Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who each gave $10,000 through their separate leadership PACs — $5,000 for the primary and the same for the general election. 
On the flip side, 10 Democratic senators, including Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.), are up for re-election in states Donald Trump won. 
The top donor to his colleagues, naturally enough, is a member of the leadership. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has given a cool $564,000 to his fellow House members. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has given $317,000, including $112,000 to the eight GOP House candidates on our list of top recipients; he contributed $10,000 to each of the eight through his Majority Committee PAC , and they all got another $4,000 each from the Californian’s campaign committee . 
On the Democratic side, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has provided her flock with $279,000 from her leadership PAC, PAC to the Future , and her candidate committee , including $28,000 to the Democrats who are among the top 10 recipients. Like McCarthy with his Republicans, Pelosi gave $10,000 to each of those candidates through her PAC, and through her campaign committee she gave another $4,000 each. 
Among senators, Tim Kaine (D-Va.) has been the most generous, redistributing $97,500 from his leadership PAC, including $20,000 to those on our leader board. 
While leadership PACs can give $5,000 per election, candidate committees can only give $2,000 (so $4,000 for the primary and general together). McCarthy, Pelosi and several other believers in early money have already maxed out what they can give directly to some of their colleagues for 2018.

By Sara Swann 
The cost of the House special election race in Montana — where voters are going to the polls today — is officially record-breaking. 
It’s unclear how Wednesday’s misdemeanor assault charges against the Republican candidate, Greg Gianforte, will affect the outcome, particularly since a large number of voters cast their ballots before today. It’s very clear, though, that this race has been a magnet for donors: Gianforte, a wealthy software entrepreneur, and his Democratic opponent Rob Quist, a folk singer, together raised $6.7 million through May 5, and another almost $900,000 from then through May 22. 
Spending by the candidates stood at $5.2 million as of May 5, the date on the most recent reports of their expenditures. 
And outside spending in the race has soared to $7.2 million, with $1.4 million of that coming in just the nine days between May 17-25. Combined with the somewhat dated candidate spending figure, that brings the cost of this faceoff to a minimum of $12.4 million, more than has been spent on any House race in the state going back at least as far as 1990. 
While a vast majority of Quist’s individual contributions have been $200 and under , Gianforte has mostly seen larger individual contributions of $2,000 plus . Hidden in Gianforte’s 48-hour contribution notices, which list all contributions of $1,000 or more, is a $500,000 donation he made to himself . That’s on top of an earliler $1 million loan he made to his campaign. Quist has not made any contributions to his campaign, save the $140 he reported before April. 
Republican party committees and super PACs have continued to dominate the outside spending in this special election to replace now-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. The top three outside spenders in the election — the Congressional Leadership Fund , the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican National Committee — all have Republican ties; together they spent $5.6 million backing Gianforte. Pro-Quist outside spending groups altogether have spent less than $1 million. 
The Democratic candidate recruited the support of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for one of his campaign events in mid-May, drawing thousands to the rally. In the 2016 primary election, Montana voted for Sanders over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . 
During one of his rallies, Gianforte was accompanied by Donald Trump, Jr. and Vice President Mike Pence. In his previous unsuccessful bid for Montana governor in 2016, Gianforte distanced himself from Donald Trump . But since Trump won the election in November, and was especially popular in Montana, Gianforte has aligned himself more closely to the president. 
Like other special elections, the one in Montana has been viewed as a referendum on Trump. However, Gianforte’s recent arrest for assault muddies the waters. Late on Wednesday night, Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs tweeted he had been “body slammed” by Gianforte after asking him a question about the Republican health care plan. Audio of the incident was later released in which Gianforte can be heard yelling at Jacobs to “get the hell out of here.” The GOP candidate was arrested and charged with misdemeanor assault after Jacobs reported the incident to authorities, and a Fox News crew that witnessed the altercation corroborated Jacobs’ allegations. 
Some state newspapers immediately withdrew their endorsements of Gianforte, but about 37 percent of Montana’s registered voters had already committed to one or the other candidate, having sent their ballots in early. The polls will close at 10 p.m. Eastern time. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.

With graduation season in full swing, immigrant graduates and children of immigrants across the country are reflecting on the roads and people who led them to where they are today. 
Last week, Define American ― a non-profit media and culture organization― partnered with Undocumedia to put out a call on social media encouraging graduates from immigrant families to share their personal stories using #ImmiGrad. The class of 2017 quickly obliged, posting sweet photos, touching anecdotes and heartwarming messages thanking their parents for their support, dedication and love.

Eliot Nelson,The Body Slam Politic,"By Eliot Nelson , Jeffrey Young William Campbell via Getty Images 
Like what you read below? Sign up for HUFFPOST HILL and get a cheeky dose of political news every evening! 
Good luck ever getting a Hill reporter to write a puff piece about your dog if you’re the congressman who body slammed a journalist (well, actually, there’s always Matt Boyle). Though we really don’t like the idea of politicians body slamming us or our colleagues , we cheered ourselves up with the idea that someone last night got really deep into a Medium essay on how terrible it was that Greg Gianforte body-shamed Ben Jacobs. And President Trump celebrated a Rasmussen poll showing him with a 48% approval rating and dear, sweet Lord, we hope a framed version of this gets hung up in the West Wing alongside that “electoral landslide” map . This is HUFFPOST HILL for Thursday, May 25th, 2017: 
VOTERS GO TO THE POLLS IN MONTANA, NO MORE BODY-SLAMMING INCIDENTS TO REPORT - Alexander C. Kaufman and Daniel Marans: “Democrat Rob Quist, a populist progressive cowboy poet known for his career as a bluegrass singer, supports single-payer health care, legalizing marijuana and funding more arts programs in schools. Republican Greg Gianforte, a tech entrepreneur who moved to the state in 1995, is a hard-line social conservative who backs the deeply unpopular GOP bill to replace Obamacare and wants to turn over control of public lands to the state. Gianforte, who narrowly lost a bid for governor last year, is favored to win the seat that Zinke handily won re-election to in November. But Gianforte’s own strategists describe him as ‘basically an unpopular incumbent trying to get re-elected.’ ... The election took an unexpected turn on Wednesday evening, when Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs accused Gianforte of ‘ body-slamming ’ him…. It’s unclear how the election-eve violence may influence Thursday’s vote. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee wasted no time trying to capitalize on it, demanding that Gianforte ‘immediately withdraw’ from the race .” [ HuffPost ] 
Naturally, congressional Republicans have identified the real villains here: “Apparently, you can body-slam a reporter for asking a question and still have a place in the Republican Party…. ‘The actual act of what he did, there’s just no way to justify that,’ said Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), who then shifted blame onto liberals . ‘I understand the frustrations that people feel because we can’t hardly go to a town hall without it just being a total denial of free speech. The left has created enormous polarization in this country.’ … HuffPost asked nearly a dozen lawmakers about the CBO score on Thursday. No one threw any punches . And yet, when asked why Gianforte couldn’t show any such constraint, many of these lawmakers expressed disappointment with the reporters themselves . ‘What’s your question, do I think body slamming reporters is a good thing?’ Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) said, laughing at reporters. ‘Ya’ll really are into this.’” [ HuffPost’s Laura Barrón-López ] 
Check out this photo gallery of politicians not body-slamming reporters . 
HOUSE GOP STILL HAPPY WITH THAT BILL STRIPPING 23 MILLION PEOPLE OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE - Ahhhh, yes, who can forget that chapter from Sun Tzu’s “Art of War” on the merits of covering one’s eyes and yelling at the top of one’s lungs, “YOU CAN’T SEE ME IF I CAN’T SEE YOU!!!” Matt Fuller: “ Republicans showed little remorse for passing the bill. ‘I said for weeks I had zero confidence in the CBO,’ Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) told HuffPost on Thursday. ‘ You would never hire them to manage your retirement plan, so it came out exactly what I expected it to be.’ Marshall dismissed concerns that the CBO indicates it would become more difficult for people with pre-existing conditions to purchase insurance in states that waive certain Obamacare regulations and that those people would see their premiums ‘increase rapidly.’ ‘The CBO’s crazy,’ Marshall said, adding that sick people would be ‘even better protected with our legislation than they would before.’” [ HuffPost ] 
Yeah, the GOP sales pitch for that bill is bull. “ Wednesday’s report from the Congressional Budget Office ought to erase any lingering doubt about how Republicans are trying to change American health care. If they get their way, they will protect the strong at the expense of the weak ― rewarding the rich and the healthy in ways that punish the poor and the sick.” [ HuffPost’s Jonathan Cohn ]

TRAVEL BAN ONCE AGAIN SLAPPED DOWN IN APPEALS COURT - Can we say it was schlonged ? That it was schlonged in appeals court? Cristian Farias: “In yet another setback for the Trump administration, a federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, on Thursday refused to lift a nationwide injunction that halted a key provision of President Donald Trump’s revised travel ban on six predominantly Muslim nations. The ruling is the most bruising the White House has suffered in its attempts to defend the ban, as it was rendered by 13 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit — which deemed the case important enough to skip the usual three-judge process that the vast majority of cases go through. U.S. Chief Circuit Judge Roger Gregory wrote that the text of Trump’s executive order, which was challenged in courts across the country for targeting members of a particular faith, ‘speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.’” [ HuffPost ] 
HOUSE REPUBLICANS TRYING TO KEEP DUMPSTER FIRE FROM GETTING TOO OUT OF HAND - Rachael Bade and John Bresnahan: “House Republican leaders, facing a serious time crunch this fall, are already plotting ways to avoid a government shutdown at the end of September — a real possibility given partisan divisions over spending priorities. Speaker Paul Ryan in a closed-door GOP conference meeting Thursday morning laid out the legislative calendar, showing lawmakers they’re approximately four months behind schedule in the appropriations process for 2018, in part because President Donald Trump’s budget landed later than usual…. House Republicans can’t agree on their own budget blueprint for next year, clashing internally over cuts to entitlement programs and safety net initiatives such as food stamps and housing aid , all while trying to create space for tax reform and a big defense spending increase. In addition, they still have to find money for Trump’s priorities, including the hugely controversial border wall between the United States and Mexico.” [ Politico ] 
NOMENTUM - We wish him nothing but success in his future endeavors, namely falling asleep during the roll call at Third Way board meetings. Rebecca Ballhaus: “ Former Sen. Joe Lieberman, once a leading contender for FBI director, on Thursday withdrew himself from consideration for the post in a letter to President Donald Trump, citing the appearance of a conflict of interest. The former Connecticut senator and Democratic vice presidential candidate works at the same law firm as Marc Kasowitz, whom Mr. Trump retained earlier this week to serve on a team of private attorneys representing him in the broad special-counsel probe of Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 election. ‘I do believe it would be best to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest, given my role as senior counsel in the law firm of which Marc is the senior partner,’ Mr. Lieberman wrote in the letter dated Wednesday, a copy of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. He thanked Mr. Trump for inviting him to discuss ‘the possibility of being nominated’ as FBI director.” [ WSJ ] 
MULLER RUSSIA PROB BIGFOOTING ALL THE OTHER RUSSIA PROBES - We like to imagine that Mueller’s probe strides into the crime scene and tells the scrappy local congressional probes that they’re taking over and that it’s going to be by the books from here on out, see. Ryan J. Reilly: “Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation of potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government will hold up congressional probes that were looking into whether Trump affiliates colluded with foreign entities to interfere with the 2016 election, a letter from the FBI indicated on Thursday. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, had requested a copy of memos that former FBI Director James Comey reportedly made to memorialize conversations with President Donald Trump…. But Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week named Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead the investigation, and the FBI told Chaffetz on Thursday that it couldn’t immediately provide a copy of Comey’s memos .” [ HuffPost ] 
TRUMP, WHAT ELSE, ATTACKS LEAKERS - MIchael D. Shear and Steven Erlanger: “President Trump condemned ‘leaks of sensitive information,’ responding on Thursday to a complaint by Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, over disclosures of details from the investigation into Britain’s deadliest terrorist attack since 2005. ‘The alleged leaks coming out of government agencies are deeply troubling,’ Mr. Trump said in a statement. ‘These leaks have been going on for a long time, and my administration will get to the bottom of this. The leaks of sensitive information pose a grave threat to our national security.’ … [T]wo dimensions of the latest controversy are new: The disclosures in this case are about a terrorism investigation led by a foreign ally, and the British government has brought its complaints to a receptive audience.” [ NYT ] 
TRUMP BASHES NATO ON ITS BIG DAY - The wake for Tony Soprano’s mother comes to mind. S.V. Date: “ President Donald Trump on Thursday publicly scolded European allies for taking advantage of U.S. taxpayers by failing to spend enough on defense ― while in private reportedly breaking with them over how to treat Russia , the country that worked to help get him elected. ‘NATO members must fully contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations,’ he said at a ceremony intended to mark the alliance’s solidarity in responding to the 9/11 attacks on America. ‘Twenty-three of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they’re supposed to be paying for their defense,’ Trump said. ‘This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States. And many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years.’” [ HuffPost ]

A GRATEFUL NATION THANKS WHOEVER HACKED HARVARD’S NEWSPAPER - Just read this. You’ll be glad you did. Bryan Menegus: “Today, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg returned to the venerable Ivy League institution he famously dropped out of, revisiting his old dorm room and giving a commencement speech to the graduating class of 2017. To commemorate the social networking titan’s return to his alma mater, the website of Harvard’s 144-year-old newspaper (or whomever gained control of it) ran as its frontpage story: ‘MARK ZOINKERBURG AT IT AGAIN.’ ” [ Gizmodo ]

Jason Linkins,The Seth Rich Conspiracy Theory Is Emblematic Of The Trump Era,"05/25/2017 05:27 pm ET The Seth Rich Conspiracy Theory Is Emblematic Of The Trump Era Trump uses conspiracy theories to attack his opponents. Now his supporters use them to defend the president. By Jason Linkins , Arthur Delaney 
Seth Rich, a young Democratic National Committee staffer who lived in Washington, died tragically on July 10 of last year, shot to death in what looked for all the world to be a botched robbery attempt. That’s the story, and this story ― while not being unimportant by any means ― should have been confined to local news and local authorities investigating the crime. 
But that’s not what happened. 
Instead, the family and friends that Rich left behind have seen their grief magnified as a result of a gallingly persistent bit of fake news . Rumors, hatched in some of the internet’s dodgier redoubts, were provided a megaphone by irresponsible right-wing media organizations ― most notably Fox News ― leading to a week of dubious, unhinged reporting that tortured Rich’s family members until they were forced to speak out about it . And to the surprise of no sane individuals, those outlandish claims have all fallen apart, leading to multiple retractions and a sudden “vacation” for Fox News’ primary purveyor of the conspiracy theories, Sean Hannity. 
The whole ordeal has been entirely emblematic of the surreal media universe that the Donald Trump era has ushered in. On this week’s edition of the “So That Happened” podcast, HuffPost reporter Travis Waldron, who covered the way in which internet rumors became a Fox News spectacle in multiple dispatches over the last week , joins the show to talk about how it came to pass that a baseless claim ― that Rich had been killed on the orders of prominent Democrats for leaking DNC emails to WikiLeaks ― became a “news” story. 
Trump launched his political career with a conspiracy theory: that Barack Obama hadn’t been born in the United States . Trump rose to power on this lie and a host of others, including one about New Jersey Muslims cheering the 9/11 attacks . At the height of his primary campaign, Trump was as likely to gin up new, outlandish conspiracies as he was to furnish policy ideas or ideological talking points. His furtherance of the zany idea that Sen. Ted Cruz’s father played a role in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy was a good example of how he went back to that well, again and again. 
And it’s hard to disassociate the Seth Rich story from Trump now, especially considering the way Hannity flogged the story for the express purpose of finding a theory behind Russian interference in the 2016 election that would provide Trump with some exculpatory wiggle room. That the Rich story filled Hannity’s news hole at the expense of other stories, less favorable to Trump, was an added bonus. 
In the end, the otherworldly claims that Hannity and others attempted to promulgate disintegrated in the light of day. In a statement posted after its story was retracted, Fox News admitted that the piece “was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting,” and that after “appropriate review, the article was found to not meet those standards.” As they say, “Too little, too late.” If anything, Fox’s retraction only shines a light on every other media organization that had the wherewithal ― as well as the standards ― to not run the story in the first place. 
And it’s anybody’s guess as to whether the lesson will be learned in such a way to prevent the next toxic rumor from going mainstream. There’s something about the Trump era that suggests this sort of thing will happen again. After all, when Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), who apparently still believes that this conspiracy theory may be true, was asked by CNN to furnish evidence to back up his claim, he responded by saying , “There’s stuff circulating on the internet.” HuffPost",english,,,,,,,,,,,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOgXmI5J8pYhiOAmQb9Iet2LMokxRJ_5AxzyVv3vjNnHPeiuh7hvao3iEdeCEJS83JZyKdEevFw4fg--,The Seth Rich Conspiracy Theory Is Emblematic Of The Trump Era,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/verticals/politics/news.xml,Politics News on The Huffington Post,2017-05-26T05:27:00.000+03:00,0,1,news,huffingtonpost.com,US,http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/1910_1000/592741a4150000210015b736.jpeg?cache=svqnwxrb2z,6,
Aleeza Ben Shalom,5 Dating Fears Everyone Has,"5 Dating Fears Everyone Has And how to control them. 05/25/2017 09:17 am ET | Updated 5 days ago 
As a dating mentor, I often hear from singles about the painful side of dating; the fears, the insecurities and the nagging voice inside each one of us that says, “You’re not good enough.” There are external fears that may have developed over the years. Maybe your mother, friend, matchmaker or random neighbor kept trying to set you up unsuccessfully and then blaming you when it didn’t work out. Your greatest fears may also come from within - your inner critic. “You aren’t doing what you should be doing, trying hard enough, or praying with enough intent. Otherwise, obviously, you would be married by now.” 
Dating fears are normal and so are you! Let’s talk about some of the most common dating fears, and what you can do about them – starting now. 1. I’m never going to get married. 
This fear hurts. It is the core of all the other fears. It has crossed the mind of virtually every person who has ever been hurt in the dating process. If you are like most singles, you aren’t married because you haven’t yet identified the right one. I’m confident you’ve been keeping your eyes open. While you may have had an expectation of when you wanted to get married, God has the master timeline. I don’t pretend to have an answer as to why you are not married yet. I can’t predict the future. What I do know is that God specifically prepares a match for each soul. 
If you have the fear that you’ll never get married you’re in good company. Having not yet met the right one is pretty common these days. However, just because you haven’t met the right one doesn’t mean you won’t meet him or her and get married. Being single is your current situation, not your destiny. Now is the time to work on loving yourself. You are getting married, and you’ll need self-love and love-of-other to keep you married. 2. What if I have to settle? 
Let’s define “settle.” Many singles think of settling as defeat or a concession to mediocrity. But settling can also mean adjusting your list of “absolute musts” that Mr. or Mrs. Right requires in order to merit consideration. Look at your list. Is it time to update or reprioritize? Certain qualities, like kindness, respect and loyalty, should never be considered unimportant. I am talking about the other bullet points, such as “well-traveled,” “has a PhD,” “wealthy,” “6’2” or “snappy dresser”… Just take a look. Settling may not mean what you think it means. 3. I’m not attractive/thin/wealthy/young/(insert your favorite self-criticism) enough. 
God did not make you the way you were by accident. We know that God has an Ultimate Plan and that it is for the good. You were born at exactly the right moment, to precisely the right parents and unique circumstances to allow you to become the inimitable person reading this article. You are not only enough; you are just the way you are supposed to be in this moment. This doesn’t release you from the obligation to continue becoming who you need to be. Growth is good, but so is self-acceptance! 4. No one wants me. 
Sit down in a quiet place and make a list of all the positive qualities, talents and skills that you have. Leave nothing out, big or small. Read this list twice daily, morning and evening, for a week. (Trust me and do this. It really makes a difference!) I hope you will realize that just as you have family and friends who love you and want to be around you, so too you will have a spouse who wants and loves you. 5. There must be something wrong with me. 
Maybe there is something wrong, maybe not. Now is the time for some honest soul searching. Is there a negative character trait or two that you have always wanted to get rid of? If so, this may be the right time to do some spiritual housecleaning to make you into a better version of yourself. 
We will never be perfect beings; we were created imperfect intentionally. So yes, there is something wrong with you, and with me too! You don’t have to be perfect to be married; you just need to be working on perfecting yourself. Those who are faced with a physical handicap, an emotional disorder or are a carrier of genetic disease face another hurdle: Realizing that what you have doesn’t define you. You are every bit as worthy! 
Pay attention and notice what tales your inner storyteller is spinning. This is the same voice that tells you not to bother asking for that promotion because you won’t get it anyway, the same one that instructs you not to even try to reach your dreams. It is unlikely you would ever say these things to anyone else, yet you speak to yourself this way! 
Where there is darkness, insert light. Fear and depression come to fill a hole inside us. Instead of fears, fill that hole with kindness and laughter. Fear overwhelms us when we neglect to appreciate the beauty in our lives. It’s true, you cannot control where, when and how you will meet the right one. You can, however, control how you spend your time until you meet your soul mate. 
Live now. Be present. Be joyous. Be nice to yourself. Be the best version of yourself. 
What have you found works to banish your fears? Comment below.

Leo W. Gerard,Trump’s Budget Slashes Opportunity For Everyday Americans,"Trump’s Budget Slashes Opportunity For Everyday Americans The rich can buy opportunity. The rest cannot. 05/25/2017 02:21 pm ET | Updated 5 days ago Getty Images 
A few hundred billion cut here, a few hundred billion slashed there, and the Trump budget proposal released this week adds up to real crushed opportunity. 
The spending plan slices a pound of flesh from everyone, well, everyone who isn’t a millionaire or billionaire. For the rich, it promises massive tax breaks. 
There are cuts to worker safety programs, veterans’ programs, Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, food stamps, vocational training, public education, environmental protection, health research and more. So much more. The list is shockingly long . 
Each incision is painful. But what’s worse is the collective result: the annihilation of opportunity. The rich can buy opportunity. The rest cannot. What was always special about America was its guarantee of opportunity to everyone. All who worked hard and pulled themselves up by their bootstraps could earn their own picket-fenced home. This budget terminates the goal of opportunity for all. It declares that the people of the United States no longer will help provide boots to those who lost jobs because of NAFTA, the residents of economically depressed regions, the children of single mothers, the sufferers of chronic diseases, the victims of natural disasters. No bootstraps for them. Just for the rich who hire servants to pull the straps on their fancy $1,500 Gucci footwear. 
The minimum-wage servant class doesn’t have a prayer under this budget. Trump condemns them to a perpetual prison of poverty. His budget denies them, and even their children, the chance to rise. It treats no better the precarious middle class and workers whose jobs are threatened by imports. It even screws veterans. Achieving the American Dream depends on a good education, and the Trump budget would extinguish that possibility... 
Achieving the American Dream depends on a good education, and the Trump budget would extinguish that possibility for tens of millions. The breadth and depth of the cuts to public education are gobsmacking. They’ll enable billionaire Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to use the money instead to subsidize private school tuition for the Gucci class. 
While DeVos helps the already-rich attend pricey private schools, she and Trump would cut $345.9 billion from public education , training, employment and social services. That includes $71.5 billion from public elementary, secondary and vocational education. They’d take $11.4 billion from education for disadvantaged children and $13.9 billion from special-needs children. 
They’d withdraw $183.3 billion from higher education including $33 billion from financial assistance. They say to kids who failed to be born to wealthy parents, “too bad for you, no low-interest student loans for brilliant poor students and far fewer grants for the talented who could cure cancer if only they could afford college tuition.” 
Many of these aspiring students can’t turn to their parents for help because they’ve lost jobs as manufacturers like Rexnord and Carrier closed American factories and shipped jobs to Mexico or China. Trump and DeVos would also decimate help for the parents to get back on their feet, eliminating $25.2 billion for training and employment. 
If the parents’ unemployment insurance runs out as they search for new jobs and their cars are repossessed, mass transit may not be an option for commuting to new positions. Trump would cut it by $41.6 billion. 
If a furloughed worker in North Dakota or Minnesota or Pennsylvania can’t afford to pay the heating bill, Trump’s government would no longer help. He would eliminate entirely the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, ending aid that can mean the difference between life and freezing to death for 6 million vulnerable Americans. 
If laid-off workers ultimately also lose their homes to foreclosure, Trump is unsympathetic. He’d cut $77.2 billion from housing assistance. His advice: take your bootless feet and live in the street. 
And don’t expect any government cheese once there. Trump would carve $193.6 billion out of food stamps. He doesn’t even spare infants, with an $11.1 billion smack to the program that feeds pregnant women and their babies. School kids can’t expect food either. Trump and DeVos say too bad for them if they can’t hear their teachers over their growling stomachs. Trump takes nearly 21 percent away from the Agriculture Department, which subsidizes school lunches for low-income kids. [T]he Trump budget... [rips] $154.1 billion from veterans’ services, including $94.4 billion from hospital and medical care... 
Trump also stiffs families that lose their health insurance because they can’t afford COBRA premiums after a job loss or can’t find new employment before their COBRA eligibility expires. Trump slashes $627 billion from Medicaid , and that’s on top of draconian cuts in his so-called health plan that would cost 14 million Americans their insurance coverage next year and 23 million over 10 years. Trump says no health care for the down and out. 
For the residents of West Virginia glens with closed coal mines, and the citizens of shuttered mill towns in Western Pennsylvania and the in habitants of Michigan municipalities struck down by offshored auto manufacturing jobs, Trump would purge $41.3 billion from the community development program that provides both jobs and otherwise unaffordable crucial municipal improvements. 
The unemployed or under-employed who hoped for jobs in Trump’s promised $1 trillion infrastructure program receive no reprieve in this proposed spending plan. It removes $97.2 billion from airports, $123.4 billion from ground transportation and $16.3 billion from water transportation projects. 
Trump is mulling sending thousands of new troops to Afghanistan , and for some young people with few options, that service is attractive because it comes with good medical and education benefits. But the Trump budget diminishes that chance at success as well, ripping $154.1 billion from veterans’ services including $94.4 billion from hospital and medical care and $511 million from veterans’ education and training. 
For young people who thought the AmeriCorps program might be an employment substitute for the military, no luck. Trump’s spending plan abolishes that service program . 
Trump’s $4.1 trillion budget redefines America. No longer the land of opportunity, it would be a place of welfare for the rich in the form of million-dollar tax breaks and subsidies for exclusive private schools. For the rest, hope would be extinguished. For them, Trump’s budget would convert America the beautiful into America the hellish hole.

Harlan Green,Has The Dismantling Of The American Health Care System Begun?,"Has The Dismantling Of The American Health Care System Begun? 05/25/2017 12:12 pm ET | Updated 5 hours ago 
Graph: CBO 
We now know that the revised Republican repeal of Obamacare is really intended to dismantle and perhaps destroy any federally-funded health care program, which would return health care to either cash-starved states or private industry; to the high cost, broken healthcare system it was before Obamacare. And all this to give the wealthiest among us a tax break they don’t need? 
We know this because the CBO and JCT estimate just out says that, in 2018, 14 million more people would be uninsured under H.R. 1628 than under current law. The increase in the number of uninsured people relative to the number projected under current law would reach 19 million in 2020 and 23 million in 2026. 
We also know this because no public hearings were held on the House plan and none are planned for the still-secret Senate plan, something that Senator Diane Feinstein said has never happened before for major legislation in her 40 years in Congress. 
And it is a very major bill. For instance, in 2026, an estimated 51 million people under age 65 would be uninsured, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law, according to the CBO . Under the legislation, a few million of those people would use tax credits to purchase policies that would not cover major medical risks, but their costs would rise because no longer protected by the ACA prohibition against raising costs for those with pre-existing conditions, for example. 
It in fact dismantles the possibility of affordable health care that covers pre-existing conditions for most Americans. It gives businesses and the wealthiest a juicy $664 billion reduction in taxes, which are the tax revenues needed to pay for the Obamacare state subsidies—mainly to reimburse states that cover their poorest Medicaid citizens. So, it’s to be paid for with a total of $1.111B in spending cuts for Medicaid and social security disability coverage. 
This is what the white racist agenda of Tea Party Republicans and President Trump is leading us towards. This is what they mean by making American great again. Let us hope there are enough intelligent Senators to block what is being done in secrecy, in the hopes that most Americans won’t notice there is nothing great about leaving a total of 53 million in 10 years—mostly the elderly and poor—without any healthcare options except the most expensive, and a budget that wants to continue to redistribute our tax dollars to the wealthiest one percent where it will do the least good. 
And Senate Republicans, while they debate their version of repeal, now face increasing pressure to rescue health insurance markets and protect coverage for millions of Americans amid growing fears that the Trump administration is going to let the markets collapse, said the LA Times . 
This is because President Trump has repeatedly threatened to withhold federal aid that helps millions of low-income Americans afford their deductibles and co-pays. The aid, which reimburses insurers for lowering out-of-pocket costs for low-income consumers, was paid by the Obama administration. But it is now the subject of a lawsuit by congressional Republicans, who argue Congress must approve the payments. 
In recent days, leading hospitals, physician groups, health insurers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have pleaded with the Senate to step in, effectively going around the White House. 
“Congress must take action now,” the groups warned in a letter to Republican and Democratic Senate leaders. “At this point, only congressional action can help consumers.” 
Can it be any clearer that health care coverage for many, if not most Americans, is in danger of collapse?

Center for Community Change Action,A Note Of Caution For The Senate: Moderates In The House Got Duped,"A Note Of Caution For The Senate: Moderates In The House Got Duped 05/25/2017 11:33 am ET | Updated 2 hours ago United Workers via flickr creative commons 
Twenty-three million people would lose their insurance. That’s the big, bold headline coming out of the analysis released yesterday by the Congressional Budget Office on the current version of the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which the House voted narrowly to approve earlier this month. That’s the number of people abandoned by moderate Republicans who got hoodwinked by a meaningless compromise and voted “yes” on the AHCA without waiting for the analysis of how it would affect everyday Americans. All 23 million of those people are watching to see how the Senate will respond. 
Despite what some Beltway insiders might tell you, voters are paying close attention to what’s happening in Washington. They want to know whether their representatives on the Hill are looking out for constituents like them, or for corporations and billionaires. Senators gearing up for a vote on their own version of the health care bill can take a moment and learn from the mistakes of their colleagues in the house. 
Like the several failed iterations before it, the latest version of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) would decimate Medicaid as we know it. It would shift billions of dollars of Medicaid funding back on to the states putting critical benefits for seniors, people with disabilities and families with kids on the chopping block. This bill would slash health care coverage for those who need it most, and the moderate Republicans that were fooled into approving it will be held accountable. 
And don’t be fooled by disingenuous claims made by Republicans that this bill ensures coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. The Affordable Care Act already did that. This bill renders those protections null and void by allowing insurers to charge people with pre-existing conditions astronomical prices for coverage. As Rep. Chris Murphy noted , this law guarantees coverage the same way we’re all guaranteed the right to own a private island – it’s meaningless if you can’t afford it. 
The pre-existing amendment that right-winger Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI) added onto the AHCA in the eleventh hour was nothing more than an $8 billion bribe to moderate Republicans to abandon their promises to voters. To put it in context, the $8 billion the amendment provides is a small percentage of the more than $300 billion it would cost to provide even moderate assistance to those with pre-existing conditions seeking coverage. It is also equivalent to less than 1 percent of the nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts for billionaires included in the bill. It’s worse than chump change; it’s Trump change. 
The Congressional Budget Office numbers show that for everyday Americans, this bill spells loss of coverage, higher premiums and skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs. Moderate Republicans in the House who were duped by Rep. Upton and his Freedom Caucus friends today are on the hook for the very real, very harmful impacts of the law they approved. 
Republican lawmakers campaigned for the better part of a decade on a promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, making dubious and downright dishonest claims along the way about the 2010 health care law and its impact on everyday Americans. But our representatives in Congress are also subject to a core promise inherent to holding elected office: to look out for the best interests of their constituents. The House’s approval of this disastrous GOP health care bill proves that many Republicans in Congress have these priorities out of order. 
After voting to strip health coverage from 23 million Americans, House Republicans went directly to the White House for a victory party with President Trump. Photos from that afternoon illustrate in living color how willing Republicans are to sell out their most vulnerable constituents to score political points. And voters will hold their lawmakers accountable for putting politics before people. On their phone lines, in their inboxes, at their town halls and, most importantly, in the voting booth next November, we will remind our representatives in Congress that their job is to look out for everyday Americans, not the president’s billionaire buddies. As the Senate works to craft their own version of the health care bill, lawmakers should watch closely. Because the American people certainly are.

Brittany Wong,'Game Of Thrones' Kit Harrington And Rose Leslie Are Moving In Together,"05/25/2017 05:47 pm ET | Updated 3 hours ago 'Game Of Thrones' Kit Harington And Rose Leslie Are Moving In Together They're getting their very own cave -- err, house. By Brittany Wong 
Real-life “Game of Thrones” couple Kit Harington and Rose Leslie are taking their relationship to the next level: They’re moving in together. 
In the new issue of “Esquire,” Harington ― aka Jon Snow ― talked about the couple’s big move and why they haven’t said much about each other since making their red-carpet debut as a pair in April 2016. 
The British actor told the mag he keeps details of the relationship private “because it’s as much [Leslie’s] relationship as it is mine and I can’t speak for both of us. But yeah, we are very, very happy. So that’s what I’ll say about that.” 
Aww. 
Harington and Leslie, both 30, were first rumored to be dating in 2012. Here they are at the Olivier Awards in London this April, looking as happy and in love as Jon and Ygritte in a cave: Jeff Spicer via Getty Images Jon + Ygritte forever. 
As tight-lipped as Harington was about Leslie to Esquire, he did let on that a move was imminent and that he and his roommate/writing partner Dan West are going through a “conscious uncoupling.” 
“He’s going off with his girlfriend, and I’m living with my girlfriend,” Harington said. 
So where is the couple moving? Apparently, the actor’s phone kept going off during the interview because he and Leslie are working with real estate agents to find a place in Manhattan. Still, they’re not set on making the Big Apple their home. 
“I’m the most fickle person,” Harington said of the house hunt. “Now I’m looking for a house in the English countryside; next week it will be Florida. Never take my word on what the f-ck I’m doing!” 
Add “real estate” to the list of things Jon Snow knows nothing about.

Priscilla Frank,Oops! Ivanka And Jared Failed To Disclose Their Million-Dollar Art Collection,"Oops! Ivanka And Jared Failed To Disclose Their Million-Dollar Art Collection Ivanka has showcased their consummate stash on Instagram. A post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Aug 8, 2016 at 5:11am PDT 
Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have quite the formidable art collection, featuring works by big contemporary names like Christopher Wool, Dan Colen, Alex Israel and Alex Da Corte. Yet, according to artnet News , Kushner, who is currently serving as President Donald Trump ’s senior advisor, did not report the multimillion-dollar cache in his required financial disclosures . 
A lawyer advising Kushner attributed his pricey omission to the fact that the wife-and-husband duo collect art for pleasure, not business. “Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump display their art for decorative purposes and have made only a single sale,” the lawyer said in a statement issued by the White House. Still, other members of Trump’s cabinet including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , did disclose their sizable art collections. 
This is not the first time Kushner has been outed for failing to be transparent about his financial assets . But now that the blunder has been noticed ― and widely publicized ― he plans to report the collection to “avoid any doubt.” The White House gave no indication as to when this new disclosure would be released. A post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Jun 7, 2015 at 3:21pm PDT 
The official rules regarding financial disclosure for federal employees are somewhat nebulous in that they differentiate art that is simply for decoration from art that serves as a business investment. According to the Office of Government Ethics , if the art is intended for investment purposes and is worth more than $1,000, it should be disclosed. 
Ivanka Trump and Kushner’s haul is certainly worth far more than $1,000; works by Da Corte and Colen are worth around half a million each . But how do you tell if an artwork is indeed “an investment”? One indication, as ethics lawyer Robert Walker told artnet, is whether or not a collector frequently buys and sells their work. 
Kushner has sold only a single artwork, which doesn’t quite qualify as “regular activity.” As Walker put it: “ A single sale does not necessarily mean that Kushner will need to disclose his art assets. ” 
Complicating this conclusion, however, is the fact that Trump herself described art as an investment in a 2015 article called “How to Start Collecting Art ,” published on her website. “Think of art as an investment,” she advised readers, leaving little room to read between the lines. A post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Dec 2, 2016 at 1:12pm PST 
Trump, who is technically covered by Kushner’s disclosures as his wife, also frequently posts photos of her pricey pieces on Instagram , where they help cultivate her carefully curated image of #refined #sophistication. 
Occasionally, artists who’ve spotted their work online have spoken out, less than keen on being associated with the Trump legacy in any way. Da Corte, for example, kindly requested: “ Dear @Ivankatrump please get my work off of your walls. I am embarrassed to be seen with you .” 
Furthermore, the First Daughter’s art-centric posts are not just humble brags, they’re good business, making Kushner’s financial omission seem all the more dubious. Trump will often juxtapose images of contemporary art with pieces from her clothing brand, arguably using the artwork’s repute to influence her own products’ character for personal gain. You know what makes a fancy purse look even fancier? A half-million dollar painting, that’s what. 
Because of the prospect that their work will somehow benefit Ivanka Trump’s brand, and thereby Donald Trump’s agenda, artists have been desperately trying to detach themselves from any and all Trump ties. An artist-led campaign called “ Dear Ivanka ” has continuously led protests online and in person.",english,,,,,,,,,,,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOh7lmaZzFmpqSRl15.QcsrPDfrbpxXM6Y2q5OWAD51GhmQiEvqKfP3D4BG7FG8sP9GhPiCLrFPXwuphPnqUPb6p,Oops!

Ariel Edwards-Levy,Most Americans Aren't Personally Concerned About Terrorism,"Most Americans Aren't Personally Concerned About Terrorism But many say they're at least somewhat scared about the state of the world. By Ariel Edwards-Levy 
Most Americans aren’t worried they’ll be personally affected by an act of terrorism, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll taken this week in the wake of an attack in Manchester, England. 
Thirty-nine percent of Americans say they’re concerned that they or someone in their family will become a victim of terrorism, with 12 percent saying they worry a great deal, and 27 percent saying they worry only somewhat. Another 50 percent say they’re not very worried, or not worried at all. 
That’s a modest uptick from a February poll , in which 32 percent were at least somewhat worried and 57 percent were not very worried or not worried at all. It’s not clear whether the change has any direct relationship to the attack in Manchester. Concerns about gun violence also ticked up, from 33 percent in March to 37 percent in the most recent poll. Huffington Post 
Asked to choose their two top concerns from a list, Americans did not focus on terrorism. Forty-one percent say they’re most worried that they or someone in their family will suffer a serious illness or injury, and 40 percent say they’re most concerned about losing a job or having financial problems. Twenty-one percent name being the victim of either gun violence or a terror attack. 
A 63 percent majority of Americans say they’re at least somewhat scared about the way things are going in the world today, with 23 percent saying they’re very scared. In February, those numbers were a nearly identical 64 and 23 percent, respectively. 
There’s a significant political divide: 41 percent of voters who supported Hillary Clinton in last year’s election say they’re “very scared,” but just 16 percent of those who supported President Donald Trump say the same. 
Other demographic divides are apparent as well. Thirty percent of women, but just 17 percent of men, consider themselves “very scared.” Older Americans are also significantly more fearful ― 36 percent of those age 65 or older say they’re “very scared,” compared to less than 20 percent of those under age 45. 
The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 23-24 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.

Kelsey Borresen,This Guy Proposed To His College Sweetheart During A Game Of Flip Cup,"05/25/2017 06:13 pm ET | Updated 5 days ago This Guy Proposed To His Girlfriend During A Game Of Flip Cup Our kind of proposal. ?? 
Two college football fans got engaged during a game of flip cup and the proposal is beer-y adorable. Chelsea Maloney The happy couple. 
In November, Bryan Cross popped the question to his girlfriend Chelsea Maloney during a tailgate at Florida State University, the couple’s alma mater, in Tallahassee. The pair, who lives in Tampa, was in town with their family and friends for the University of Florida versus Florida State rivalry game that Thanksgiving weekend. 
At the tailgate, the group set up a table for flip cup ― a popular relay-style drinking game ― and told Chelsea to stand at the end, directly across from Bryan, so that they would be opponents. 
Chelsea went last on her team and when she finally flipped her red Solo cup, she noticed two magical words and a heart written on the bottom: Chelsea Maloney The cup read, ""Marry me?"" 
“As you can tell by the shocked look on my face, I actually thought I was imagining it because it seemed too perfect!” Chelsea told HuffPost. “I had to process that this was actually written on the cup. Then once I looked at Bryan holding a box and everyone looking at me smiling, my thoughts were pretty much, ‘No way is this really happening.’” 
That’s when Bryan got down on one knee and presented her with a ring. 
“I couldn’t control my tears of joy knowing that the man I loved most in the world wanted me to spend the rest of my life with him and that our dearest family and friends were there to be a part of this special moment,” Chelsea told HowHeAsked. Chelsea Maloney Scenes from the special day. 
To make the proposal all the more perfect, Chelsea and Bryan first met in 2010 at an FSU tailgate where they played flip cup against one another. 
“Funny thing is that neither of us remembered each other’s name so in his phone he saved my number as ‘tailgate girl’ and I saved his as ‘flip cup kid’,” Chelsea told HowHeAsked. “The next time a tailgate rolled around I got a text from ‘flip cup kid’ saying, ‘Hey, tailgate girl, come tailgate today.’ That began our tailgate love story.” 
The couple is getting married in April 2018 and plans to have a bridesmaids versus groomsmen flip cup game on the big day.

Nina Golgowski,Holocaust Survivor Receives High School Diploma At Age 88,"05/25/2017 05:45 pm ET Holocaust Survivor Receives High School Diploma At Age 88 Of all the things Esther Begam says she regretted in life, it was never finishing school. By Nina Golgowski Captivate Media Consulting Esther Begam was 11 years old when Nazis invaded her native Poland and separated her from her family. 
A Holocaust survivor who was separated from her family and a formal education at the age of 11 has been awarded a high school diploma, securing what became a lifelong dream. 
Wearing a royal blue cap and gown, 88-year-old Esther Begam entered a Plymouth, Minnesota, high school auditorium on May 10 to a round of applause.

The empowering moment was decades overdue, with Begam sharing how she was forced into Nazis work camps after the 1939 invasion of Poland by Germany started World War II. This followed her being separated from her parents, brother and sister. 
“I can’t tell you everything that was going on because you might cry with me,” she said in a recent interview with Captivate Media Consulting, in which she recounted her harrowing life story. 
Begam’s longtime desire to receive her diploma was first shared in 2010, when she visited with students at Wayzata High School where her granddaughter worked as a secretary. 
There, while speaking with students, one asked her what her biggest regret was. 
“I expected her to say, I wish we would have run, I wish we would have hidden, I wish we would have saved pictures,” teacher Candice Ledman recalled to KARE-TV. “She said, ‘The one thing I regret is not getting my high school diploma.’” 
Begam shared that her parents were both highly educated people, with her father, who was a rabbi, having served as a chaplain in the Polish army. 
At the war’s end, against her greatest hope, she learned that her family had perished at the Auschwitz concentration camp.

At the age of 17, she married another Holocaust survivor and moved to the U.S. Having never finished school, however, remained a sore spot in her heart. Upon hearing of her longing, Ledman said she asked the school’s administrators if they could make Begam’s dream a reality. 
The request was initially turned down and not brought up again until a new principal came to the school, Scott Gengler. Once he heard the family’s request, he granted almost immediate approval, Ledman said. 
“It’s 71 years overdue,” Gengler told KARE-TV of the request. 
Asked in her interview if she had any advice she’d give others, Begam answered: “Just try to do your best. Try what you can do. Don’t over do it.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST Nina Golgowski Trends reporter, HuffPost MORE:",english,,,,,,,,,,,http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOi2bwnOeI6SZfxQtFaaLuigIU7vrxE71lsumaD5GZwoXFOuevDr.1HdvNimNai.RI9XDseI_HBSUMOmXfh44SIOtHrtnxGi3S2kbkdMNLLamw--,Holocaust Survivor Receives High School Diploma At Age 88,http://www.huffingtonpost.com//feeds/index.xml,The Huffington Post | The Full Feed,2017-05-26T05:45:00.000+03:00,0,1,news,huffingtonpost.com,US,http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/1910_1000/5927315c150000210015b6de.png?cache=2gfjbyxiib,4,
Jessica Schulberg,Former Obama Officials Relieved By Partial Victory On Iran Sanctions Bill,"Former Obama Officials Relieved By Partial Victory On Iran Sanctions Bill The Senate Foreign Relations Committee heeded warnings from former officials and modified the legislation. By Jessica Schulberg 
WASHINGTON ― The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a modified version of an Iran sanctions bill on Thursday that includes changes recommended by former Obama administration officials. 
The original version of the sanctions bill had broad bipartisan support. But Obama-era national security officials warned that it risked violating the Iran nuclear deal and alienating U.S. allies. 
With Republicans now in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, Iran deal advocates didn’t have much leverage to convince lawmakers to tweak the legislation. But with a well-coordinated public and private messaging campaign, a group of Obama alumni succeeded in altering two sections of the bill they deemed risky. 
The amended legislation, approved by a vote of 18-3, changes language that would impose sanctions on anyone the president determines “poses a risk of materially contributing” to Iran’s ballistic missile program, to anyone who “knowingly” contributes to the program. The original description, critics argued, was overly broad and would have been difficult to enforce. 
“What if your car company was used to haul a missile?” said Richard Nephew, who was the lead sanctions expert on the U.S. team during the Iran nuclear negotiations. 
Lawmakers also reworded a section that would have created new conditions for lifting some ballistic missile sanctions that are set to expire in seven years as part of the nuclear deal. The original wording risked violating the nuclear deal by changing the terms of sanctions relief, critics said. 
The modifications closely mirror changes recommended by former officials who served in the previous administration’s National Security Council, State Department, Treasury Department, CIA, and Pentagon . Days after lawmakers introduced the bill in March, seven Obama-era foreign policy staffers proposed three changes to the text. 
Earlier this month, former Acting Treasury Secretary Adam Szubin embraced two of those proposed changes in a letter to members of the Foreign Relations Committee. The two changes endorsed by Szubin ultimately made it in the amended text of the bill. 
“In almost every meeting we’ve had with members and staff since Mr. Szubin and other Obama administration officials weighed in, the offices have referenced their opinions as reasons for concern,” a lobbyist who advocated for changes to the legislation told HuffPost. Szubin, an Obama appointee who served briefly under President Donald Trump, “had a particular impact on the Republican side because he is someone who is known and not seen as overtly political,” the lobbyist added. 
The only recommendation from former Obama staffers that failed to make its way into the amended bill was the removal of language that imposes sanctions reserved for global terrorist groups on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a component of Iran’s military. Critics warned that the language will have the practical effect of designating the IRGC as a foreign terrorist group, a move that defense officials have warned could compromise U.S. military operations in Iraq. Because the IRGC is involved in a significant portion of Iran’s business transactions, the designation could scare foreign companies away from doing business with Iran, which would undermine sanctions relief promised to Iran under the nuclear deal, Nephew said. 
Of the 21 members on the committee, only four ― Sens. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) ― voted in favor of a failed amendment to modify the IRGC provision. 
Convincing lawmakers to make any changes to a bill that was likely to pass with bipartisan support in its original form was a coup for critics of the legislation. But even with the modifications, some Obama administration officials say they remain concerned about potential effects of new sanctions legislation on the fragile international nuclear accord. 
The evening before the committee vote, former Secretary of State John Kerry warned lawmakers against passing a new sanctions bill in the immediate aftermath of the re-election of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the more moderate of the candidates. 
Jeff Prescott, a former National Security Council official who helped draft the March warning to lawmakers, said on Thursday that the changes to the bill may prevent “an outright violation” of the nuclear deal, “but we remain concerned about lending bipartisan license to an Administration that has signaled an intent to revisit aspects of the nuclear deal and escalate against Iran in the absence of a clear strategy or diplomatic engagement.” 
That concern was echoed even by some lawmakers who voted in favor of additional sanctions. “The reticence that some of us have brought to this debate is due to the fact that we worry that this can be construed as a congressional pre-endorsement” of future actions by the Trump administration that could undermine the deal, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said on Thursday, shortly before the committee vote. 
Though the Trump administration has so far upheld U.S. obligations under the nuclear deal and certified Iranian compliance, the president has indicated a willingness to change course. In a recent joint statement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia ― Iran’s main regional adversary ― the two countries agreed that “the nuclear agreement with Iran needs to be re-examined in some of its clauses.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Sam Levine,Jared Kushner Reportedly Draws Interest Of FBI In Russia Investigation,"05/25/2017 06:50 pm ET | Updated 7 hours ago Jared Kushner Reportedly Draws Interest Of FBI In Russia Investigation Kushner has come under scrutiny because of contacts with Russian officials. By Sam Levine 
The FBI is looking at Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and an influential White House adviser, as part of its investigation into Russia’s influence in the 2016 election, The Washington Post and NBC News reported Thursday evening. 
Kushner has not been accused of wrongdoing, both outlets noted. Sources told the Post that Kushner has come under scrutiny because of two meetings with Russian officials in December ― one with Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak and another with a banker. 
Kushner met with Kislyak in December and Sergey Gorkov, the head of Vnesheconombank, a state-owned bank, after Trump was elected, at Kislyak’s request. 
Kushner initially did not disclose the meetings on an application for a security clearance. His lawyer later acknowledged he had made an error and amended the application. Kushner has also voluntarily agreed to meet with the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss the meetings. 
U.S. intelligence officials have already concluded that Russia interfered in the U.S. election through hacking with the goal of getting Trump elected. Several officials involved with the Trump campaign, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and campaign manager Paul Manafort, have also come under scrutiny for connections to Russia. Earlier in May, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey as his bureau investigated the Russian links. Following Comey’s firing, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special prosecutor in the investigation.

Michael Calderone,Montana Station Won't Air Recording Of GOP Candidate's Attack On Journalist,"05/25/2017 06:40 pm ET | Updated 5 hours ago Montana TV Station Won't Air Recording Of GOP Candidate's Attack On Journalist Right-leaning Sinclair Broadcast Group recently purchased the local NBC affiliate, but the general manager says the company didn’t interfere. By Michael Calderone 
If Montana residents tuned into the local news Wednesday night on NBC affiliate KECI, they wouldn’t have heard an audio recording of Republican House candidate Greg Gianforte attacking Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs, even as it got widespread airplay on national television and online. 
“NBC Montana takes pride in reporting only verifiable facts from independent, reliable sources, officials and documents, regardless of what is reported by other media outlets,” anchor Laurel Staples explained to the 10 p.m. audience. (A similar statement appeared in KECI’s online reports.) 
Earlier that evening, The Guardian posted a recording in which Jacobs is heard asking Gianforte a question about health care policy right before the candidate snaps. Jacobs’ recording, which contradicted claims by Gianforte’s campaign that the “liberal journalist” was the aggressor, quickly became a key part of the unfolding story. 
Before the night was over, Gianforte ― squaring off Thursday against Democrat Rob Quist in a special House election ― had been charged with misdemeanor assault. 
KECI’s coverage ― or lack thereof ― drew attention on Twitter in part because the station’s parent company was recently bought by Sinclair Broadcast Group, though the deal hasn’t been completed. Sinclair, which owns 173 outlets nationwide and is poised to add dozens more, has history of boosting Republican candidates. The Washington Post and The New York Times have reported on how Sinclair’s management tilting local news stations to the right through story-selection and framing of events. 
Tamy Wagner, KECI vice president and general manager, told HuffPost in an email that the station “did not have specific instructions or any instruction from Sinclair,” in its handing of the Gianforte story. 
“We do not put unverified information and audio tapes on the air in any case, political figure or not,” Wagner said. 
Instead, Missoula-based KECI essentially framed the incident as a “he said/he said” dispute between Gianforte and Jacobs. 
Jacobs’ recording was aired during a Thursday segment on the “Today” show, the national morning show broadcast on local NBC affiliates like KECI. Still, the station’s newscasts opted not to run it. 
The newscasts on Wednesday night and Thursday morning also failed to acknowledge that Jacobs’ version of events had been quickly backed up by a Fox News reporter’s eyewitness account . 
“Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground behind him,” wrote Fox News reporter Alicia Acuno, who was present with two colleagues. “... I watched in disbelief as Gianforte then began punching the reporter. As Gianforte moved on top of Jacobs, he began yelling something to the effect of, ‘I’m sick and tired of this!’” 
UPDATE: May 26 ― New York magazine’s Yashar Ali reported Thursday night that KECI news director Julie Weindel initially told NBC News the station wasn’t covering the incident and refused to share footage with the national outlet. She also referred to Jacobs in an email as a reporter for a “politically biased publication.” 
Weindel told New York that they “needed to be confident that we were able to verify the information and report the facts” and that there were no “clear and undisputed facts” at the time of the exchange NBC News. She said the station went on to “aggressively” report the story and sent information to NBC and MSNBC.

Ben Walsh,"Trump Reportedly Called Germans 'Very Bad,' Vowed To Stop German Car Sales In The U.S.","05/25/2017 06:43 pm ET | Updated 2 days ago Trump Reportedly Called Germans 'Very Bad,' Vowed To Stop German Car Sales In The U.S. “See the millions of cars they are selling in the U.S. Terrible."" By Ben Walsh , Akbar Shahid Ahmed 
During a meeting with top leaders of the European Union, President Donald Trump said “the Germans are bad, very bad,” according to participants in the room who spoke to German weekly news magazine Der Spiegel. 
Trump’s specific criticism was that Germany’s auto industry exported cars. “See the millions of cars they are selling in the U.S. Terrible,” Der Spiegel reports he said. “We will stop this.” 
In January, Trump threatened to slap a 35 percent tax on German auto imports. “If you want to build cars in the world, then I wish you all the best. You can build cars for the United States, but for every car that comes to the USA, you will pay 35 percent tax,” he said. “I would tell BMW that if you are building a factory in Mexico and plan to sell cars to the USA, without a 35 percent tax, then you can forget that.” 
Trump’s new comments impugning the Germans for exporting cars were made in a meeting with the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the European Council president, Donald Tusk. Juncker, Der Spiegel reports, supported the Germans. 
Another German newspaper, Süddeutsche Zeitung, reported that E.U. representatives felt their U.S. counterparts did not understand that the E.U. negotiates trade agreements as a single entity, rather than on a country-to-country basis. That is, the U.S. can negotiate trade deals with the E.U. as a whole, but not individually with the separate members of the E.U. 
Der Spiegel reported that Gary Cohn, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, appeared to believe that the U.S. could negotiate different trade deals with Germany and Belgium. 
This is not the first time this basic misunderstanding has cropped up. When German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited the White House in March, she had to explain how E.U. trade deals were negotiated almost a dozen times, a senior German official told the Times of London . 
“Ten times Trump asked [Merkel] if he could negotiate a trade deal with Germany. Every time she replied, ‘You can’t do a trade deal with Germany, only the EU,’” the official said. “On the eleventh refusal, Trump finally got the message, ‘Oh, we’ll do a deal with Europe then.’” 
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. 
The revelations came hours after Trump publicly blasted the U.S.’s European partners in the NATO defense alliance, accusing them of owing American taxpayers billions of dollars because they have previously not met the alliance’s defense spending requirements. He also failed to affirm that his administration would meet its commitment to militarily support them if needed. 
The president has repeatedly questioned Washington’s relationships in the region, cheering Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and engaging positively with anti-EU politicians like France’s Marine Le Pen. Top political figures and Europe analysts have already labeled his trip a major failure, and it’s not even over yet: Trump is expected to now head to Sicily for a summit of the G7, a group of the world’s most developed economies.

Akbar Shahid Ahmed,American Seeking Trump Administration Help Turns 18 In Egyptian Jail,"American Seeking Trump Administration Help Turns 18 In Egyptian Jail Ahmed Hassan, locked up since December, says he just wants to finish his studies. By Akbar Shahid Ahmed 
WASHINGTON ― An American caught up in the Egyptian government’s ongoing wave of repression turned 18 on Thursday behind bars, where he has been since December. 
“Six months of my life have been wasted with no reason,” Ahmed Hassan told HuffPost Thursday during a brief phone call permitted by the authorities. “Today’s my birthday and I’m in jail right now. ... I’m so sad, and physically I’m just down.” 
Egyptian police seized Hassan in December, when he tried to block the arrest of his uncle for a minor building code violation. He has been jailed with adults since then. A judge handed him a one-year sentence in February. 
Hassan is one of up to 20 Americans believed to be held by the Cairo government, which human rights advocates say is engaging in the cruelest crackdown in recent Egyptian history. The teen wrote to President Donald Trump about his case in April, seeking intervention, and lawmakers from his home state of New Jersey have repeatedly sought Trump administration help as well. 
Last month, Trump loudly celebrated his role in personally intervening to push Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi to release U.S. citizen Aya Hijazi, an aid worker. But advocates for Hassan and the other detainees have complained of inaction since then. 
“The U.S. embassy in Cairo didn’t do anything for me,” Hassan said. “They came to see me for just two minutes and sat in the office of the police officer. They didn’t see where I am, where I live, where I eat. ... Just came to say, hello, how’s it going?” Praveen Madhiraju Ahmed Hassan's family lived in New Jersey before moving back to Egypt some years ago. 
That story is consistent with a letter the State Department sent to Hassan’s congressional representatives this month. The letter, shared with HuffPost, said consular staff would be willing to help him change incarceration facilities if he chooses. 
Hassan said he is confined in a room with 23 adult men, “sleeping in a very, very small place” and surviving on small portions of bread. His family is in Egypt, where they moved from New Jersey some years ago, but relatives are only allowed to see him for a few minutes each week, Hassan said. 
“Because I’m an American citizen, they don’t want to do anything easy to me. They didn’t want me to get out,” Hassan said. “When they know that I’m an American citizen, they tell me: ‘You think that because you’re an American citizen you will get out? You will still be in jail.’” 
Hassan, in his March 25 letter to Trump, wrote: “I am proud to be an American. I beg you to defend my right to be free.” 
He said he believes video footage of his arrest proves he did nothing wrong. In a video shared publicly by Egyptian American activist Mohamed Soltan, two figures who appear to be in uniform stand on either side of a man and march him toward a vehicle. A figure ― presumably Hassan ― tries to stop them, and one of the apparent security officers begins to beat him. The man fights Hassan to the ground and then drags him into the vehicle. 
Hassan said he hopes to continue his studies once he’s released. 
For now, there’s no evidence of serious Trump administration action on his behalf. Sens. Cory Booker (D) and Bob Menendez (D), and Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R), all of New Jersey, asked the president to raise the matter during a meeting with Sisi in Saudi Arabia last weekend. Hassan’s lawyer, Praveen Madhiraju of the nonprofit Pretrial Rights International, told HuffPost on Thursday he had not heard that Trump acted on the request.

Author and lawyer Qasim Rashid frequently finds himself playing the part of teacher for Islamophobes on Twitter. Backed by more than 70,000 followers, he tries to demystify common misconceptions about Islam.

Rashid recently posted a long and informative series of tweets explaining that the Quran commands men, as well as women, to observe hijab rules ― that is, principles of modesty. The word “hijab” also refers specifically to a head covering that some Muslim women choose to wear. 
In all likelihood, the Twitter user was actually referring to the songkok ― an Indonesian cap worn by some Muslim men ― which Rashid is seen wearing in his profile photo.

Mary S Papenfuss,Onion Begs Gianforte To Beat Its Bad Staff Because They All Ask Questions,"05/25/2017 08:39 pm ET Onion Begs Gianforte To Beat Its Bad Staff Because They All Ask Questions Please 'punish us with considerable physical force' if we ask for a clarification, jabs the satirical publication. By Mary Papenfuss 
The wisecrackers at The Onion are pleading with Montana congressional candidate Greg Gianforte to please beat up its reporters because they’re so bad about asking politicians questions. 
The tongue-in-cheek cheek provided a bit of comic relief in the stunned wake of Gianforte’s witnessed “body slamming” of a Guardian reporter who dared to ask him about Trumpcare. 
GOP billionaire Gianforte was charged with misdemeanor assault after the altercation Wednesday night, the eve of the special election for Montana’s lone congressional seat. He’s running against Democratic folk musician Rob Quist, and polls close Thursday night. 
At least three newspapers yanked their endorsement of Gianforte, backed by Donald Trump , after a Fox News crew said they witnessed him grabbing reporter Ben Jacobs by the neck, hurling him to the floor and punching him after the journalist asked him about the Congressional Budget Office report on the GOP health care replacement bill. Greg Gianforte just body slammed me and broke my glasses — Ben Jacobs (@Bencjacobs) May 24, 2017 
The satirical Onion professed total understanding that such questions can be bothersome to politicians from the “power-mad, out-of-control media.” The press, obviously, should “subserviently” provide a “mouthpiece to trumpet the will and intentions of the ruling class without question and without complaint,” it added. 
Therefore, The Onion noted, it’s “imperative” that those who “hold the reins of power put us in our place and punish us, preferably with considerable physical force.” 
If “any of our journalists have ever made Mr. Gianforte feel threatened in any way ... by holding a recorder too close to his face ... seeking clarification on a point ... we encourage him to use his fists, knees, elbows, or a blunt object of his choice to make it known through repeated physical blows how we have upset him,” The Onion added. 
Gianforte was even invited to The Onion’s offices, where he can walk along rows of desks “so that he may assault each and every one of us.” 
Few others were laughing. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Gianforte should apologize to Jacobs . The Helena Independent Record declared: “Democracy cannot exist without a free press, and both concepts are under attack by Republican U.S. House Candidate Greg Gianforte. 
Gianforte’s camp said the candidate had been provoked to action because Jacobs “shoved a recorder in his face” and grabbed his wrist, which was not supported by witness accounts. Montana’s Democratic governor responded that not only was Gianforte’s assault outrageous, but so was his defense. 
“It is unsettling on many levels that Greg Gianforte physically assaulted a journalist and then lied, refusing to take responsibility for his actions,” Gov. Steve Bullock, who defeated Gianforte in his 2016 reelection bid, said in a statement .

Carla Herreria,Californian Sues Jelly Belly Over Sugar-Packed Jelly Beans,"05/25/2017 09:09 pm ET Californian Sues Jelly Belly Over Sugar-Packed Jelly Beans Jelly beans have sugar, but the woman claims the company was wrong to label it as ""evaporated cane juice."" Jason Stitt via Getty Images Jelly beans are candy, and most candy contains sugar, lest we all forget. 
A California woman claims that the candy company Jelly Belly tricked her into buying its Sport Beans , a candy that doubles as a diet supplement to “fuel” the body and help burn fat, which had more sugar than she thought. 
Jessica Gomez, of San Bernardino County, filed a class-action lawsuit against the jelly bean company in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles in February. She claims that the company attempted to mask how much sugar was in its Sport Beans Energizing Jelly Beans by labeling sugar as “evaporated cane juice” on the list of ingredients, Forbes magazine reported. 
“The term ‘evaporated cane juice’ is false or misleading because it suggests that the sweetener is ‘juice’ or is made from ‘juice’ and does not reveal that its basic nature and characterizing properties are those of a sugar,” an attorney representing Gomez wrote in a letter to the company. 
The lawsuit also alleges that Jelly Belly misleads its consumers by claiming the Sport Bean contains carbohydrates, electrolytes and vitamins as a way of advertising the product for athletes, according to court newswire Legal News Line. 
Gomez accuses the company of fraud, negligent misrepresentation and product liability. Jelly Belly Jelly Belly advertises its Sport Bean on its website with images of athletes. 
The nutritional information on the Sport Beans’ packaging says that one serving size of the product (28 grams) contains 17 grams of sugar and lists “evaporated cane juice” as the first ingredient for each flavor. 
However, the Sport Beans website lists “cane sugar” on its ingredient list and says that one serving contains 19 grams of sugar . Jelly Belly Jelly Belly's Sport Beans are advertised as a product that gives athletes ""quick energy."" 
In an April motion to dismiss the case, attorneys for Jelly Belly said, “This is nonsense,” according to the San Francisco Gate. 
“No reasonable consumer could have been deceived by Sports Beans’ labeling,” the motion read. “Gomez could not have seen ‘evaporated cane juice’ without also seeing the product’s sugar content on its Nutrition Facts panel.” 
While it may seem shortsighted to assume that a jelly bean does not contain sugar, Gomez’s lawsuit does point to a larger issue on food labels. 
Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and author of Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health , said in a 2014 blog post that “evaporated cane juice is the food industry’s latest attempt to convince you that ... it is natural and healthy, better for you than table sugar and much better for you than high fructose corn syrup.” 
And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seems to agree. 
Last year, the FDA announced that labeling sweeteners derived from sugar cane as “evaporated cane juice” is misleading and encouraged companies to relabel the ingredient as “sugar.” 
The FDA said in a 2016 press release that the term is misleading because “it suggests that the sweetener is fruit or vegetable juice or is made from fruit or vegetable juice, and does not reveal that the ingredient’s basic nature and characterizing properties are those of a sugar.” 
Gomez’s attorneys and representatives of Jelly Belly did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment by the time of publication.

Will Rogers,Secretary Zinke: Please Leave Our National Monuments Alone,"Secretary Zinke: Please Leave Our National Monuments Alone This attempt to roll back protections for national monuments is unprecedented and terribly misguided. 05/25/2017 07:16 pm ET | Updated 4 days ago Bob Wick 
Today, on behalf of The Trust for Public Land and its many volunteers and supporters, I am registering our concern with President Trump’s executive order to review certain monument designations . 
Our public lands and waters help define who we are as a nation by telling the story of our historical, cultural, and natural heritage. This attempt to roll back protections for national monuments is unprecedented and terribly misguided. Secretary Zinke, we strongly urge you to reject efforts to eliminate or shrink our national monuments. 
The Trust for Public Land has worked over many years to protect important conservation lands at several national monuments currently under review and we have worked to ensure public land protection at other recently created monuments including California Coastal, Stonewall, Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers and Pullman. Our experience was always positive, with strong community support and engagement. In California, for example, the impetus for the Mojave Trails and Sand to Snow national monuments came from Mojave Desert residents and business leaders, who organized for years in support of them. 
The Antiquities Act has been used well by Presidents throughout our history for important and lasting public land protection. This current review is clearly aimed at undermining presidential authority under the Act. Should this result lead to reversals of current protection, those steps will have a lasting negative impact and threaten many protected areas for generations to come. 
Regarding the expedited review of the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, we question the need for this condensed timeline but urge you, Secretary Zinke, to retain the monument’s current status. That area’s priceless historic, cultural and natural wonders are exactly the places and values which should be permanently protected. Monument status for Bears Ears protects 100,000 archaeological and cultural sites as well as stunning mesas, canyons and arches and the incredible outdoor recreation, hunting, fishing and general solitude and peace they contain ― treasures which are irreplaceable. It is clear the area has deep and important meaning to several Native American tribes, given their involvement in the long-standing protection effort and recent vocal opposition to rolling back protections. The boundaries of the monument clearly honor the voices of five sovereign tribal nations who joined together to seek protection of their shared ancestral lands and traditions. 
We strongly believe rolling back the Bears Ears protections would threaten all our monument areas by setting a terrible precedent. Once that door is open, where might it stop? Such actions would discourage business investment and community growth around national monuments while also sending the signal that our history and natural wonders are negotiable. This already seems to be the case in Maine where a review of the Katahdin Woods and Waters national monument has caused uncertainty about the area’s economic future, halting positive signs of economic growth following the August 2016 designation. 
National monuments are tremendous drivers of the $887 billion outdoor recreation economy. Businesses in gateway communities rely on the permanency of these protections when making decisions about local investments. Visitation has doubled at Organ Mountains National Monument since its designation. At the nearby Rio Grande del Norte National Monument, the Bureau of Land Management saw a 40% increase in visitors within a year after that land was designated a monument. A report by the Green Taos (N.M.) Chamber of Commerce said that within just a year after that designation, the town’s lodging revenue increased 21% in the second half of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. This experience has been repeated over and over at other sites. 
Our system of national parks, many of which began as monuments, has been called “America’s best idea” and they are enormously popular with the American people. Our public lands provide thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic impact. They ensure permanent access to America’s unique cultural and natural history. The judicious use of the Antiquities Act, by presidents of both parties, has been a key tool in protecting that legacy of special places. There should be no rollbacks of protections, at Bears Ears or other monuments.

Jennifer Bendery,The Most Futile Fight In Washington: Authorizing Wars,"05/25/2017 09:36 pm ET The Most Futile Fight In Washington: Authorizing Wars Some senators have this radical idea that Congress should vote on bombing raids and foreign invasions. Here's why they're likely to lose that argument. Again. By Jennifer Bendery Tom Williams via Getty Images ""He's got... h gh hopes. He's got high apple pie in the sky hopes."" -- Frank Sinatra lyrics about Sens. Jeff Flake or Tim Kaine, perhaps. 
WASHINGTON ― At a time when health care reform and Russia investigations are sucking all the oxygen out of Congress, two senators ― a Republican and a Democrat ― filed into a small press gallery on Thursday to try and shine a spotlight on another pressing matter: war. 
Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) introduced a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force against the Islamic State, al Qaeda and the Taliban. It would give Congress new oversight over military action against those groups and over the countries in which U.S. bombings can take place. It would also repeal old AUMFs still in effect. The senators paired up on a similar bill in 2015 , and it went nowhere. There’s no clear indication that this latest incarnation will have success, either. 
Yet, the two senators insisted that times are different. 
Flake enthusiastically said the Senate Foreign Relations Committee could take up their bill soon after the Memorial Day break. Kaine said he expects, now that they’ve filed a bill, that Trump administration officials may start working with them on the specifics of a new AUMF. A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Their problem isn’t that they lack ambition, or are making a weak case. After all, many lawmakers don’t like that the White House currently can use a sweeping 2001 AUMF to justify military action against al Qaeda or ISIS anywhere, anytime, without congressional oversight. 
Their problem is, outside of a motley crew of rank-and-file lawmakers , nobody particularly cares. 
Flake and Kaine unveiled their bill to a room of a dozen or so reporters, and as many empty seats. Their 2015 AUMF bill never got a Senate committee hearing, never mind a floor debate or vote. Similar AUMF proposals in the House haven’t gone anywhere, either. The two senators said they told their respective party leaders about their latest plan to push the AUMF issue again, and said neither had much of a reaction. 
“He’s not opposed to it or in favor it,” Flake said of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). 
“He knows it’s an obsession of mine,” Kaine said of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). “His attitude is … we’ll see what comes out of committee.” 
McConnell spokesman Don Stewart didn’t say how McConnell feels generally about the need for an AUMF debate. But he noted the administration is in the middle of reviewing its strategy for fighting ISIS, and once that’s done, President Donald Trump may need additional authorities to carry out his mission. 
“One could envision, in that scenario, that they’d ask for an AUMF that supported the strategy,” said Stewart. “But as that hasn’t happened yet, I don’t have any guidance on what the review will yield.” 
A Schumer aide did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Yuri Gripas / Reuters Defense Secretary James Mattis has said he supports Congress passing a new war authorization for ISIS. But then again, so did President Barack Obama's defense secretary, and it never happened. 
The Constitution says that it’s the role of Congress to declare wars, and that the president has to get lawmakers’ approval for any sustained military action. But Congress ceded some of its power in 2001, when it hastily passed the broad AUMF allowing President George W. Bush to attack anyone connected to al Qaeda, anywhere, at any time. That AUMF never expired, and President Barack Obama stretched its limits to argue he could unilaterally take military action against the Islamic State, too, since the terror group is an offshoot of al Qaeda. 
Today, that means Trump can use a 16-year-old war authorization to bomb people anywhere, at any time, without Congress signing off, so long as he can make the case that Islamic State or al Qaeda targets are there. 
That makes some lawmakers uneasy. But for all their discomfort with how the 2001 AUMF is being used, most are simply afraid to take a war vote ― one that would shape the duration, scope or troop levels in forthcoming military actions ― that could come back to haunt them. 
Kaine and Flake are holding out hope that responsibility will prevail over cowardice in Congress. They won’t concede that this is a fruitless task. 
“Why do I have hope ...” began Kaine, relaying a story about his multiple failed attempts as a Richmond City Council member to move city elections from May to November. 
“It took me seven years, and now we have November elections,” he said. “I don’t give up easy.” 
Flake rattled off his own reasons for optimism. More than half the members of Congress are new since their previous AUMF, he explained, which means fresh votes to recruit. There’s a new administration in the White House. And the new defense secretary has signaled support for a new AUMF . (Then again, so did the last one ). 
“I believe they will want it because it strengthens their hand as they enter negotiations, or just diplomacy,” Flake said of the Trump administration. “We think that this bipartisan language does a good job.” 
But didn’t his last AUMF bill have good language, too? 
“This is better,” Flake said. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Here’s how.

William S. Becker,Climate 101 For The President,"William Becker, Contributor Presidential Climate Action Project Climate 101 For The President There is a fundamental reason that America cannot be an outlier on climate change: It is physically impossible. 05/25/2017 06:47 pm ET | Updated 4 days ago Kevin Lamarque / Reuters 
President Trump has been bombarded with reasons to keep the United States in the climate agreement the international community achieved two years ago in Paris. Everyone from the Pope to America’s leading CEOs have urged Trump to stay the course. 
As he nears a decision, Trump also has been peppered with platitudes from predictable lobbies about how the Paris deal, as well as climate action in general, will bankrupt the economy and kill jobs. That is a false fear. Consider: Common sense tells us that climate change is far more likely to bankrupt the economy than climate action. The impacts of a disrupted climate will carry enormous costs for families, communities, businesses and governments. The costs will be reflected in everything from food prices families pay because of cropland drought or flooding, to higher premiums for homeowners’ insurance and higher taxes to cover rising government costs for disaster preparation, response and recovery. A successful international collaboration to cut carbon emissions is good for the U.S. economy. Economists at New York University have calculated that the current climate policies of other nations have benefited the U.S. economy by more than $200 billion. Future actions like those nations have pledged as a result of the Paris accord could save the United States more than $2 trillion by 2030 and more than $10 trillion by 2050, the economists report. Trump is trying to rescind the cornerstone of the United States’ commitment in the Paris deal, EPA’s Clean Power Plan to limit carbon pollution from power plants. But the Plan would likely lead to a net increase of 360,000 American jobs in 2020 – a gain that would decline but remain positive through 2030 – according to the Economic Policy Institute . Among other things, the Plan would result in more carbon-free wind and solar power in the United States, two technologies that are already creating jobs 12 times faster than the overall economy. Energy efficiency, another fundamental tool for cutting carbon emissions, already employs more than 2 million Americans. 
These are a small sample of why it is in the national interest for the United States to remain a party to the Paris deal, even if the Administration only represents what is being done by our states and cities . Trump should also embrace one of the provisions that bothers America Firsters: the promise that the United States and other advanced nations will help developing countries grow their economies with clean energy. As the New York University’s research shows, it helps us to help others. Firsters can take comfort, too, in how the Paris deal handles the age-old tension between national sovereignty and international agreements. Each nation’s participation and specific commitments to reduce carbon pollution are self-determined and voluntary. 
Beyond jobs, economics and sovereignty concerns, there is a fundamental reason that America cannot be an outlier on climate change: It is physically impossible. Every nation’s carbon emissions and carbon reductions affect every other nation. Here are some animations to illustrate this: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Animation 1 : Nations have borders, but natural systems don’t. This animation from NOAA shows how ocean currents and wind patterns circulate worldwide. These natural conveyor belts ensure that every nation’s carbon pollution affects every other. Animation 2: Looking back nearly 280 years, we can see how carbon pollution from industrialization began in England, then spread to other countries and regions. The emissions illustrated here were the result of human fossil fuel combustion, gas flaring and cement production from 1751 to 2008. NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office Animation 3: Riding on large-scale weather patterns, CO2 pollution circulates around the global. What is not absorbed by oceans and terrestrial carbon “sinks” accumulates in the atmosphere to produce the greenhouse effect. It has become a global problem whose solution requires a sustained and collaborative international response. Good Magazine Animation 4: Nations began working on a climate deal in 1995. It took more than 20 years of negotiations to achieve the Paris agreement. Meantime, carbon emissions continued to climb, making an effective response to climate change more difficult and expensive. The long road to international cooperation is what made the Paris agreement so historic. Bloomberg Animation 5: Signals from the planet tell us that time is running out to prevent runaway climate change. This graph depicts 137 years of scientific records that show how humans are transforming Earth’s climate. The bright red line at the top represents 2016, the third year in a row that set a new record. The surge in planetary temperatures over this time period have been the steepest and most sustained in the modern age. New York Times Animation 6 : The early impacts of climate change already are underway in the United States, manifesting as record-setting rain and snow storms, heat waves, floods, drought and sea-level rise. This animation shows how drought progressed in the U.S. during 2015. National Geographic Animation 7: With warmer oceans expanding and with polar ice melting, NASA reports that sea levels are rising by 0.35 millimeters per year. While that sounds like very little, some coastal communities in America’s Mid-Atlantic region are experiencing floods more than 45 days per year. In parts of New Jersey, floods are 10 times more common than in the 1950s. This animation shows that If all of the Earth’s ice melted, seas would put some of the world’s largest cities completely underwater. The Nature Conservancy Animation 8 : Global warming will affect vegetation and wildlife as well as humans. This map shows the likely migratory routes of mammals, birds and amphibians as they try to follow the conditions that are hospital to their species. Recent studies at Purdue University have found that tree species in the U.S. are already moving north and west to follow water availability. 
These are a few of the things we should hope that President Trump thinks about as he make his final decision on the U.S. government’s role in international climate action.

Score one for Comedy Central’s Moshe Kasher. The host of “ Problematic ” managed to troll one of the Internet’s most notorious right-wing trolls. 
Mike Cernovich, a supporter of President Donald Trump and an organizer of the right-wing “DeploraBall” held before the inauguration , sat down for an interview in an episode that aired earlier this week. 
“I always say ‘no’ to TV because all you people want to do is edit things out of context ,” Cernovich said. 
“I give you my word, we would never edit you out of context like that,” Kasher vowed. “That’s not the kind of show we do here.” 
Turns out that’s exactly what he did. Check it out in the video above. 
Cernovich, for his part, took it in stride ― although not without a dig at another Comedy Central show: First successful comedy bit in years. Take notes for the daily show. https://t.co/hkrv32DTXe — Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) May 25, 2017 I lol'ed. We talked for 2 hours tho, put out that full video @moshekasher .
